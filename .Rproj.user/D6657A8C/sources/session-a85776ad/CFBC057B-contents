## Midterm Dataset

### Source

After selecting the dataset from the list provided in class, I entered the link under source, which led me to the epa.gov webpage.

### Finding the Dataset

I scrolled down, and in the website's footer, under connect, I selected the option called Data. EPA data is organized by topic to help users find the necessary information.

The topic I selected is **air**, which goes over **air quality data** from stationary and mobile sources to protect public health and public welfare.

(You may also find the data by searching datasets in the lookup section and selecting "Air Data Air Quality Data Collected at Outdoor Monitors Across the US.")

### Downloading the Data

Once you choose the topic, we go to the "Download Data" section and select "Download Daily Data." Here, you will find a tool that queries daily air quality summary statistics for the criteria pollutants by monitor. You can get data for specific monitors or all monitors in a city, county, or state.

The pollutant I chose was **ozone**, and the year I selected it was 2023. The geographic area is Florida. The cities to be considered are Miami,Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. Specifically in the Miami-Dade county. I selected All Sites and clicked "Get Data," which downloaded an Excel file.

### About the Dataset (Summary)

The topic I chose is Airquality focused on air pollutant, specifically ozone. Ozone is a harmful gas formed when pollutants from vehicles, industries, and other sources react with sunlight. We will look into the levels in Florida, Miami,Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. Specifically in the Miami-Dade county. There are 21 variables in this dataset and 710 observations.

-   **Date** refers to the date on which air quality measurements were taken.

-   **Source** refers to the origin or provider of the air quality measurements.

-   **Site ID** represents a unique identifier for a specific monitoring location or station where the air quality measurements are collected.

-   **POC** is the numeric Event Number.

-   **Daily Max 8-hour Ozone Concentration** refers to the highest average ozone concentration measured over an 8-hour period within a single day.

-   **Units** indicates the measurement units used for the various air quality parameters recorded in the dataset.It is measured in parts per million (ppm).

-   **Daily AQI Value** refers to the Air Quality Index (AQI) value calculated for a specific day.The AQI is a numerical scale used to communicate the quality of the air in terms of how it affects health.

-   **Local Site Name** refers to the specific name or designation given to the monitoring location or station where the air quality measurements are taken.

-   **Daily Obs Count** refers to the number of observations or measurements taken for a specific air quality parameter on a given day.

-   **Percent Complete** indicates the proportion of data that is available and valid for a given parameter or time period compared to the total amount of expected data.

-   **AQS Parameter code** is a unique identifier used by the Air Quality System (AQS) to categorize and specify different air quality parameters measured in the dataset.

-   **AQS Parameter Description** it provides a textual description of the air quality parameter associated with a specific AQS Parameter Code.

-   **Method Code** refers to a unique identifier assigned to a specific method or technique used for measuring an air quality parameter.

-   **CBSA Code** it stands for Core Based Statistical Area Code. It is a unique identifier used in the United States to designate specific geographic areas defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for statistical purposes.

-   **CBSA Name** refers to the descriptive name of a Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA).

-   **State FIPS Code** i is a numeric code assigned to each U.S. state and federal district by the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).

-   **State** refers to the U.S. state or jurisdiction where the air quality measurements were collected.

-   **County FIPS Code** it is a numeric code assigned to each county or equivalent jurisdiction within a state by the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).

-   **County** refers to the specific county or equivalent administrative region where the air quality measurements were taken.

-   **Site Latitude** refers to the geographical latitude coordinate of the monitoring site.

-   **Site Longitude** refers to the geographical longitude coordinate of the monitoring site.

### Cleaning Data

I went over the Excel document and did not observe any NA values. I did however, encounter some blank cells in the Method Code. All the cells had the number 47 but I chose to delete those that did not have any method listed since I did not want to assume.

I removed all NAs in my data set by selecting the dataset, going to Data in the menu bar, choosing a filter, and checking NAs off.

### Variables to evaluate

The variables I will consider are Daily AQI Value and Local Site Name. Our goal is to analyze the air quality by location.
