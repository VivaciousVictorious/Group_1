### Dataset

In today's class we continued to use the airquiality dataset which measures the air quality measurements in New York daily as of May to September 1973.
These are only the summer months.
The source is the New York State Department of Conservation (ozone data) and the National Weather Service (meteorological data).It has 6 variables (Ozone, Solar, Wind, Temperature, Month, Day) and 153 observations.

### Chosen Variables

The two variables I will analyze are Ozone and Temperature.
The ozone variable measures the ozone levels in parts per billion from 1300 to 1500 hours at Roosevelt .
The temperature is the maximum daily temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at La Guardia Airport.
We want to evaluate if higher temperatures affect the ozone levels.

## Scatter Plot

In this scatter plot, we evaluate ozone and temperature.
Ozone is on the X-axis, which represents the ozone levels per billion.
Temperature is on the Y-axis, and the values are in degrees Fahrenheit.
We can observe an upward trend as ozone levels and temperature increase.
However, most of the data points are located in clusters between 0 and 80 for ozone and between 60 and 100 for temperature.
We find a couple of outliers beyond 120 ppb of ozone, but they are scattered and very few.
This suggests that the higher the temperature, the higher the ozone levels are.

## Histogram

![](Ozonehist.png)

The previous histogram evaluates the ozone levels and how frequently different ranges of ozone values appear in the dataset.
The X-axis is the ozone ranges divided into bins.
The Y-axis shows the count (frequency) at which they occur.
The graph shows that most ozone readings fall in the lowest bin (1,25), with almost 50 occurrences.
The second largest group is (25,49).
We may conclude that lower ozone levels are more common in the dataset (or in New York).
Higher ozone levels are rare.

## Pivot Table 1

![](Pivot1.png)

This pivot table analyzes the average temperature and average ozone levels per day of the month.
The temperature values range from approximately 70째 to 84째, while ozone levels vary from 12 to 97.
The first few days of the month appear to have the highest temperatures.
Ozone levels exhibit more significant fluctuations compared to temperature.
This suggests that ozone concentrations are more influenced by factors other than simple seasonal patterns.

## Pivot Table 2

![](Pivot2.png)

Here, we have a pivot table with ozone levels on the row label and average temperature on the column section.
We are looking into the average temperature in the different groups of ozone levels.
I made the groups by selecting the desired range, right-clicking, and selecting the group.
Group 1 has (1,24) ozone level, and Group 2 has (27,50), Group 3 (52,76), Group 4 (77,97), and Group 5 (108,168).
We can observe the temperature correlation whenever the ozone levels are from 1 to 25 and so on.
The table shows us that the average temperature is higher in the (77,97) range.

## Pivot Table 3

![](Pivot3.png)

The previous pivot table is looking into the corresponding maximum of ozone levels and temperature given each month we are considering.
the months are form May to September which are summer months.
We observe that August had the highest ozone levels with 168 levels per billion and also the highest temperatures with 97 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Pivot Table 4

![](Pivot4.png)

The previous pivot table is looking into the corresponding minimum of ozone levels and temperature given each month we are considering.
the months are form May to September which are summer months.
We observe that May had the lowest ozone levels with 1 level per billion and also the lowest temperatures with 56 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Pivot Table 5

![](Pivot5.png)

This pivot table analyzes the relationship between wind speed and temperature to explore potential correlations.
Wind speeds range from around 1.7 to 20.7 units, while temperatures vary between 57째 and 94째, indicating substantial fluctuation across different wind speeds.
A general pattern suggests that temperatures tend to decrease as wind speeds rise.
However, exceptions to this trend imply that other factors may also impact temperature.
