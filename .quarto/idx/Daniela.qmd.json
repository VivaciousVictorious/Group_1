As well, we were introduced to the usage of the pivot tables and how crucial they are to analyze data and clever information for the data set. In my opinion, pivot tables expand even more the capacity to analyze data in multiple forms and variations.\n\n#### **Steps for a data set pivot table/ chart**\n\n**1.** Clean data set\n\n**2.** After cleaning the data set and making sure there's no NA's we can proceed and press command +A and select the data set.\n\n**3.** By selecting \"Insert\" we can start working on the \"pivot table\" section\n\n**4.** Then choose which variable will go either on values, rows, columns and filter.\n\n**Pivot Table #1** *Month's Max Airquality*\n\n![](Month's%20Max%20Airquality_RodriguezDaniela%20.png)\n\n![](Month's%20Max%20Airquality%20Chart_RodriguezDaniela%20.png)\n\n**Pivot Table #1 Insight**\n\n-   Max of Solar.R has the highest values across all months ranging from about 250 to 350 units.\n-   Max of Temp is the second highest metric, with values around 80-100 units for all months.\n-   Month 5 (Likely to be May) has the highest \"Max of Solar.

Researchers use this data to track how the virus spread over time and across different regions in Alaska. The data also shows how the virus moved between wild birds, backyard poultry, and mammals, helping scientists understand the patterns of transmission.\n\n**Link to the page**\n\n-   <https://www.usgs.gov/data/data-genomic-characterization-highly-pathogenic-h5-avian-influenza-viruses-alaska-2022>\n\n**Variables for this project**\n\n1.

For this second part I learned how to create a parameter. First is important to name the parameter and also choose the data type based on the type of data that I am comparing (**float or integer** ).\n\n**3.** After creating a parameter now it's time to create a visualization by dragging variables into columns and rows either **numerical or categorical**\n\n**4.** Now, for the next step, is essential to create a dashboard and display all visualizations.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) collected these samples in 2018, 2019, and 2021 to study how the oil is breaking down over time.\n\n-   They tested for different chemicals that could indicate natural cleanup processes. Some of these chemicals, if present in high amounts, could be harmful to human health or the environment. The data includes things like organic carbon, ammonium, and other substances to see if the oil spill still poses any risk today.\n\n-   As well, I created my Dashboard for this project:\n\nhttps://public.tableau.com/views/DanielasBiGDataDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Saturday</strong></summary>\n\nINSERT TEXT HERE\n\n</details>\n\n<h2>\n\nWEEK FOUR\n\n</H2>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Wednesday</strong></summary>\n\nINSERT TEXT HERE\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary><strong>Friday</strong></summary>\n\n## Jupyter Lab Work\n\nWe learnt Visualization using Python today.
