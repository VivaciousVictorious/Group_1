## **Air quality Data Set**

### **Details for Airquality**

-   **Ozone** : Mean ozone in parts per billion from 1300 to 1500 hours at Roosevelt Island.
-   **Solar .R** : Solar radiation in Langleys on the frequency band 4000-7700 Angstroms from 0800 to 1200 hours tat Central Park.
-   **Wind** : Average wind speed in miles per hour at 0700 and 1000 hours at LaGuardia Airport.
-   **Temp** : Maximum daily temperature in degrees Farenheit at La Guardia Airport.

### **Where is the data source retrieved from?**

-   The data were obtained from the New York State Department of Conservation(ozone data) and the National Weather Service (meteorological data).

#### **What did I learned?**

I learned how to clean a data set through excel and prepare the data. As well, we were introduced to the usage of the pivot tables and how crucial they are to analyze data and clever information for the data set. In my opinion, pivot tables expand even more the capacity to analyze data in multiple forms and variations.

#### **Steps for a data set pivot table/ chart**

**1.** Clean data set

**2.** After cleaning the data set and making sure there's no NA's we can proceed and press command +A and select the data set.

**3.** By selecting "Insert" we can start working on the "pivot table" section

**4.** Then choose which variable will go either on values, rows, columns and filter.

**Pivot Table #1** *Month's Max Airquality*

**Pivot Table #1 Insight**

-   Max of Solar.R has the highest values across all months ranging from about 250 to 350 units.
-   Max of Temp is the second highest metric, with values around 80-100 units for all months.
-   Month 5 (Likely to be May) has the highest "Max of Solar. R" value.

**Pivot Table #2**

**Pivot Table #2 Insight**

**1. Analysis pivot table**

-   This analysis provides insights into the seasonal patterns of these air quality metrics, showing how they change throughout the summer months and highlighting the variability in measurements both within and between months.

**2. Metrics Measured**

-   Average Temperature

-   Average Solar Radiation (Solar. R)

-   Average Wind Speed

-   Average Ozone Levels

**3. Temperature Trends**

-   Highest in month 9(September), with an average of 91.2 F

-   Lowest in month 5(May), averaging 232 units

-   Generally increases from May to September

**Data for Genomic Characterization of Highly Pathogenic H5 Avian Influenza Viruses from Alaska in 2022**

**Citation Information**

-   **Publication Year**:2024
-   **Title**: Data for Genomic Characterization of Highly Pathogenic H5 Avian Influenza Viruses from Alaska in 2022
-   **DOI**: 10.5066/P13RDHRQ
-   **Authors**: Laura C Scott, Christiana A Ahlstrom, Mia K Torchetti
-   **Product Type**: Data Release
-   **Record Source**: USGS Digital Object Identifier Catalog
-   **USGS Organization**: Alaska Science Center

**What is this project about?**

-   This dataset contains genetic information from 2022 on highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (bird flu) viruses. Researchers use this data to track how the virus spread over time and across different regions in Alaska. The data also shows how the virus moved between wild birds, backyard poultry, and mammals, helping scientists understand the patterns of transmission.

**Week 3 Wednesday Data Set: Economics_long_ggplot2**

**Details on Wednesday Class**

**1.** I've learned how to use Tableau and its various features to gather data, create dynamic visualizations, and enhance those visuals to make them both insightful and visually appealing."

**2.** How to create a Parameter? For this second part I learned how to create a parameter. First is important to name the parameter and also choose the data type based on the type of data that I am comparing (**float or integer** ).

**3.** After creating a parameter now it's time to create a visualization by dragging variables into columns and rows either **numerical or categorical**

**4.** Now, for the next step, is essential to create a dashboard and display all visualizations. Then just adjust visualization and create special place for each of them.

**Economics_long_ggplot2**

-   This data its composed by 4 columns. The variables are **date**, **variable**, **value**, **value01**

-   Moreover, this data explains and analyzes the trends in consumer spending over time. It helps idnetifying changes in spending behavior, inflation, or economic growth during the given period.

## **Week 3 Data Set for Midterm Project: Analysis for Organic and Inorganic Data at Bemidji, Minnesota**

**What is this data set about?**

-   This data is about samples collected from soil water at a site in Minnesota where a large oil spill occurred in 1979. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) collected these samples in 2018, 2019, and 2021 to study how the oil is breaking down over time.

-   They tested for different chemicals that could indicate natural cleanup processes. Some of these chemicals, if present in high amounts, could be harmful to human health or the environment. The data includes things like organic carbon, ammonium, and other substances to see if the oil spill still poses any risk today.

-   As well, I created my Dashboard for this project:
