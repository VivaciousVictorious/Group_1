Heat Maps**\n\n-   **Explanation**:\n\n-   The data set I am working is from the 2018 data set from Hurricane Irma data set. With these visualizations I am trying to explain and demonstrate the ozone levels of the two Heat Maps. The two heat maps---time-based heat map and geographic heat map---differ in purpose, structure, and the type of data they visualize.\n\n-   **What do I want to interpret?**\n\nI want to interpret both the differences but as well the importance of the two Heat Maps. Both, the Time-Based Heat Map and the Geographic Heat Map help preparing a broad and expanded visualization of this data set and expresses the information in a very clear way.\n\n**1. Time-Based Heat Map**: Helps in understanding temporal trends---such as daily or weekly ozone changes---which can highlight seasonal effects or events.\n\n**2.Geographic Heat Map**: Highlights spatial patterns, showing which regions have higher or lower levels of ozone, useful for geographic analysis or targeting specific areas for environmental or public health interventions.\n\n## Geographic Distribution of Average Ozone Levels in 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lubridate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'lubridate'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    date, intersect, setdiff, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- read.csv(\"Hurricane_Irma_2018_Cleaned.csv\")\n\ndata$Date <- as.Date(data$Date, format=\"%m/%d/%y\")\ndata$Month <- month(data$Date)\ndata$Week <- week(data$Date)\ndata$Day <- day(data$Date)\n\nggplot(data, aes(x=Week, y=Day, fill=`Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration`)) +\n  geom_tile(color=\"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low=\"yellow\", high=\"red\", name=\"Ozone Level (ppm)\") +\n  labs(title=\"Ozone Levels Across Days/Weeks in 2018\",\n       x=\"Week of the Year\", y=\"Day of the Month\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Month, ncol=3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Daniela_Ozone-Levels--Heat-Map-and-Scatter-Plot-_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Ozone Concentration Patterns Across Geographic Locations\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(sf)  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLinking to GEOS 3.12.1, GDAL 3.8.4, PROJ 9.3.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- read.csv(\"Hurricane_Irma_2018_Cleaned.csv\")\n\ndata$Date <- as.Date(data$Date, format=\"%m/%d/%y\")\n\ndata_summary <- data %>%\n  group_by(Site.Latitude, Site.Longitude) %>%\n  summarise(Average_Ozone = mean(as.numeric(Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration), na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Site.Latitude'.

This value shows the peak ozone concentration recorded within an 8-hour period each day. Y-axis represents the Daily AQI Value, which is a summary measure of air quality, taking into account various pollutants, with higher values indicating poorer air quality.\n\n**2.Color Coding:** The points are color-coded by Local.Site.Name, distinguishing data from two different monitoring sites (or locations). This allows for an easy comparison between sites. Scatter Plot of Temperature vs. Humidity\n\n**Interpretation of the plot:**\n\n**1.Correlation:** The scatter plot helps visualize the relationship (correlation) between ozone concentration and AQI. If there's a strong positive correlation, points would trend upward from left to right, showing that higher ozone levels are associated with higher AQI values (indicating worse air quality).\n\n**2.Comparison Across Sites:** By color-coding the sites, you can compare if one site tends to have higher ozone concentrations or AQI values than the other. For example, one site may show a tighter grouping with higher AQI values for certain ozone levels, possibly due to regional pollution sources or environmental factors.\n\n**3.Insights on Air Quality:** This plot can reveal thresholds where ozone concentration begins to significantly impact AQI, or if one site generally has better or worse air quality.\n\n## Scatter Plot of Ozone Concentration vs AQI with Regression Line\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata <- read.csv(\"Hurricane_Irma_2018_Cleaned.csv\")\n\ndata <- data %>%\n  mutate(Ozone_Concentration = as.numeric(Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration),\n         AQI = as.numeric(Daily.AQI.Value))\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = Ozone_Concentration, y = AQI, color = Local.Site.Name)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + # Adds regression line without confidence interval\n  labs(title = \"Scatter Plot of Ozone Concentration vs AQI with Trendline\",\n       x = \"Daily Max 8-Hour Ozone Concentration (ppm)\",\n       y = \"Daily AQI Value\",\n       color = \"Site\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Daniela_Ozone-Levels--Heat-Map-and-Scatter-Plot-_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nData Points (Scatter Plot): Each point represents a day's reading of Ozone Concentration (in parts per million, ppm) and AQI (Air Quality Index). **1. X-axis:** Displays the daily maximum 8-hour ozone concentration. Higher values mean more ozone in the air. **2. Y-axis:** Shows the AQI value, where higher numbers indicate poorer air quality. **3. Points** are colored by Local.Site.Name, distinguishing data from two monitoring locations.\n\n**Interpretation**:\n\n**Strength of Correlation:** The regression line helps visually confirm the strength of correlation. A strong, clear upward slope across both sites indicates that ozone concentration is likely a significant contributor to AQI changes.\n\n**Site-Specific Insights:** If one site has a steeper slope, it implies a stronger sensitivity to ozone levels, possibly due to local factors like industrial activity, traffic, or geography.\n",
