## Midterm Dataset

After selecting the dataset from the list provided in class, I entered the link under source, which led me to the epa.gov webpage.

### Finding the Dataset

I scrolled down, and in the website's footer, under connect, I selected the option called Data. EPA data is organized by topic to help users find the necessary information.

The topic I selected is air, which goes over air quality data from stationary and mobile sources to protect public health and public welfare.

(You may also find the data by searching datasets in the lookup section and selecting "Air Data Air Quality Data Collected at Outdoor Monitors Across the US.")

### Downloading the Data

Once you choose the topic, we go to the "Download Data" section and select "Download Daily Data." Here, you will find a tool that queries daily air quality summary statistics for the criteria pollutants by monitor. You can get data for specific monitors or all monitors in a city, county, or state.

The pollutant I chose was ozone, and the year I selected it was 2023. The geographic area is Florida. The city is Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL. Miami-Dade specifically. I selected All Sites and clicked "Get Data," which downloaded an Excel file.

### Cleaning Data

I went over the Excel document and did not observe any NA values. I did however, encounter some blank cells in the Method Code. All the cells had the number 47 but I chose to delete those that did not have any method listed since I did not want to assume.

I removed all NAs in my data set by selecting the dataset, going to Data in the menu bar, choosing a filter, and checking NAs off.

### Scatter Plot

I created a scatter plot by selecting the data, clicking insert in the menu bar, and selecting scatter plot in recommended charts. The following plot does not really tell us any valuable information other than the site latitude and longitude remains the same.

### Line Plot

I created a line plot by selecting the data, clicking insert in the menu bar, and selecting line plots in recommended charts. The following plot does not do a good job at telling us any valuable information and has too much information. ![](Line.png)

### Bar Chart

I created a bar chart by selecting the data, clicking insert in the menu bar, and selecting bar chart in recommended charts. Bar charts and clusters were the recommended chart by Excel. ere we can observe a clearer interpretation. It also opened in a new sheet and allows us to edit the information it contains and what we want to display in the chart.

### Pie Chart

I created a pie chart by selecting the data, clicking Insert in the menu bar, and selecting pie charts from the recommended charts. We can observe that the pie chart was not able to form given the information we have. Therfore, it would not be a good chart to work with for this dataset.

### Histogram

I created a Histogram by selecting the data, clicking insert in the menu bar, and selecting Histogram in recommended charts.

## Conclusion

After observing the charts, we may reach the conclusion that bar charts or clustered charts are the best option to analyze the dataset.
