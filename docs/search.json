    "text": "Welcome to Victorious’ Page. Here, you will find all of Victorious’ submissions throughout the semester. This page is intended to track Victorious’ progress in the class and over the course of the semester.\n\nWeek One\n\n\n\nWedneday\n\nAug 28th 2024\n\nAir Quality Data Modeled using Excel\n\nInstructions:\n\nGo to our class in D2L table of contents, choose a dataset and explore\nRepeat the steps of the previous example, but do the most amount of different plots you can.\n\n\nI used a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between wind and temperature.\n\nThe plot shows a negative correlation between wind speed and temperature, meaning with increased wind speed, the temperature begins to drop. It also reveals most data points are clustered around the temperature range of 60/90 degrees and wind speed of 5/15 units, this indicates common wind and temperature within the sampled area.\nThe downward trend suggests that higher wind speeds tend to be associated with lower temperatures, but the variability in the data indicates that this is not the only factor affecting temperature.\nScatter plot seem best for visualizing relationships, below plot reveals the Ozone levels across different temperature ranges.\n\nThe plot reveals a generally positive relationship between temperature and ozone levels, with higher temperatures leading to higher ozone levels. The presence of an outlier suggests that under certain conditions, ozone levels can spike significantly, which may require further investigation to understand the underlying causes. The outlier might be a result of wrong calculation, error in transferring of data or a weather anomaly. At any rate, further investigation will be required to reach a conclusive decision.\nOzone distribution was also recorded to visualize Ozone concentration in the dataset.\n\nThe histogram shows that low ozone concentrations are the most common in the dataset, while higher concentrations are much less frequent. This right-skewed distribution suggests that most observations are clustered at lower ozone levels, with only a few instances of higher concentrations that could be outliers or represent unusual conditions.\n\n\nCloser analysis of concentration intervals:\n[0, 22]: This first interval has the highest frequency, with around 80 observations. This suggests that most ozone levels in the dataset are quite low.\n[22, 44] and [44, 66]: The frequency decreases significantly in these intervals, showing that moderate ozone levels are less common but still present.\n[66, 88] and above: The number of occurrences in these intervals continues to drop, indicating that high ozone levels are uncommon.\nThe highest intervals, [132, 154] and [154, 176], have almost no observations, confirming that extreme ozone levels are rare.\n\n\nI assumed there must exit a relationship between solar radiation and season, so i tried to module this relationship with a bar chart:\n\nIt made no sense. So i tried with a pivot bar chart:\n\nThe chart indicates that solar radiation peaks during the summer months, particularly in July, which aligns with typical seasonal patterns. These are the summer months where countries experience longer day light, stronger sunlight which typically leads to higher solar radiation emissions.\nThe presence of the “(blank)” bar suggests that are some missing data which resulted from cleaning the dataset and replacing ‘0’ value where ‘NA’ were otherwise recorded, specially in the solar.r data.\nOverall, the chart helps visualize how solar radiation varies throughout the year, highlighting the expected seasonal changes in sunlight exposure.\n\n\nWhat plot do you think represents the better data? The Pivot Chart followed by the Scatter Plot. For the purpose of the weeks lessons i will choose the Scatter Plot that models the relationship between temperature and windspeed.\nWhy? It gives for easy calculation, it depicts the best fit line for regression calculation, the different occurrences in the dataset; displaying what data cluster looks like, negative correlation and outliers. This chart could be easily chosen to teach basic statistics. However, with the Pivot Chart, it is easy to read and understand straightaway and interpret what the chart is inferring but will not be chosen to teach intro to statistics or Excel in R.\n\n\n\n\nFriday\n\n\nAtitudes\n\nInstructions:\nGo to our class in D2L table of contents, choose a dataset and explore\nRepeat the steps of the previous example, but do the most amount of different plots you can.\n\nDataset Name: Attitude\nSize = 706bytes\n\nWhat is in the Attitude dataset:\n\nThe dataset seems designed to evaluate different aspects of the work environment and how they relate to employee satisfaction, performance, and opportunities for growth.\nFor the purpose of the class, this dataset shall be applied to students instead of employees. It will be used to understand how student experience learning, how they rank their school/university, lecturers performance and opportunity for growth or continuing in higher ed within the same school.\nAnalyzing this data can help in understanding the factors that influence students attitudes towards a school and identifying areas for improvement within that school.\n\nDataset Variables:\nRating: This is the overall score or satisfaction rating given by students, perhaps based on their experience at the school.\nComplaints: Represents the number of complaints or grievances filed by students, possibly indicating dissatisfaction or issues in the school environment.\nPrivileges: Refer to the benefits or perks that certain students receive, such as the gtsnts, scholarship, PhD student privileges, or other library/sports privileges.\nLearning: Opportunities for learning and practicum, like training programs or skill enhancement opportunities available to students within certain discipline.\nRaises: Indicates how frequently or generously students receive privileges. This could be tied to grades. Students are giving raises according to their academic performances.\nCritical: This measure how critical or demanding the work load on the students are, possibly reflecting the level of pressure or stress students undergo to get these privileges.\nAdvance: Indicates opportunities for advancement within the university, showing how easy or difficult it is for students to become professors.\nData Modelling and Visualization\nRelationship between Rating and Raises\n\n\nThe scatter plot indicates that there is an upward trend, that is, higher ratings are often associated with higher raises. Meaning that students who receive grants and scholarships tend to rate their university experience positively and vice versa.\nMost of the data points are clustered in certain areas of the plot, particularly where the ratings and raises are both mid to high. This could mean that majority of students who receive reasonable raises are also moderately to highly satisfied.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe positive correlations suggests that raises might be tied to performance or satisfaction. Students with higher marks may receive better raises as a form of reward.\nConversely, receiving scholarship and grants could incentivize a student to earn higher grade.\n\nDistribution of Learning Scores\n\nThe histogram reveals that learning scores are distributed across the dataset with most scores centered around the median indicating that most students have similar learning experiences.\nMajority of learning scores fall within the middle range, around the median of 55.5, which suggests that most students rate their learning opportunities similarly, neither extremely high nor low.\nInterpretation\nThe histogram shows that the university might have a consistent approach to offering learning opportunities, as most are centered around the middle.\nOn a good note, since the data is not heavily skewed, it means there might be room for improvement.\nCorrelation Between Complaints and Privileges\n\nThe scatter plot points are somewhat dispersed around the trend line, meaning that while there’s a general trend showing a positive correlation between complaints and privileges, the correlation isn’t very strong. Some points might be far above or below the trend line, indicating instances where the number of complaints and the level of privileges do not follow the general pattern. This variability suggests that other factors might be influencing the relationship, or that the correlation between complaints and privileges is moderate rather than strong.\nConclusion:\n\nThe dataset reflects complex relationships where certain metrics correlate positively with outcomes like privileges and raises. However, these relationships are not straightforward, indicating the presence of other influencing factors.\nThe distribution of scores and the variability observed suggest diverse performance levels and outcomes within the data, hinting at the need for further detailed analysis to uncover underlying drivers.\n\nWhat plot do you think represents the better data? The distribution of learning across the dataset.\nWhy? The histogram depicts the distribution learning scores accurately, it holds several information; for instance, certain score ranges are more common which indicates varying levels of difficulty or achievement among the participants. This could so by the school of departments design. It could be that convergence of performance around mean is due to standardized assessments or common learning patterns which most students have come to expect or most students understood the topics more than other topics.\nReported the findings in - excel-basics_Attitude_Fashina_082624.\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\n\nWeek 1 Project\n\n\nVisualization Of National Centers For Environmental Information (NCEI) Dataset\n\nInstruction for completing assignment:\nFrom your project source provide simple visualization of a dataset you can find in your source.\nAdd the method used and the following information to your quarto report:\nThe context of the dataset\nThe dataset is a collection of meteorological observations from a specific weather station identified as “KJELLER AIRPORT, NO”. This dataset is used by the National Center For Environmental Information (NCEI) for studying weather trends, creating predictive models, or understanding how atmospheric conditions change over time.\nBased on the column names and data structure, the dataset consists of:\n1. Geographical Information: - STATION, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, ELEVATION: These columns provide details about the specific location where the weather observations were recorded.\n2. Time-based Observations: - Date/Time: The dataset records weather data at hourly intervals, providing a time-series structure for analyzing weather patterns.\n3. Meteorological Data: - SLP (Sea Level Pressure): Atmospheric pressure at sea level, which is useful in studying weather systems, such as predicting storm conditions or high-pressure systems. - WND, TMP, VIS, DEW, etc.: These columns seem to encode data on wind speed/direction, temperature, visibility, dew point, and other weather-related variables. They are stored in a format that requires further decoding.\n4. Purpose: - It would appear that the is used for tracking and analyzing weather conditions over time at the specified station. It could be useful for forecasting, climate studies, or aviation-related weather monitoring.\nThe source and link to the dataset - (csv)\n\nThe source is National Centre For Environment Information (NCEI)\nhttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/access/2024/01466099999.csv\nName : 2024-08-26 10:32 - 93K\nOriginal dataset consists of 301 rows and 25 columns.\nCleaned dataset consists of 301 rows and 28 columns.\n9 columns were deleted(correlation with other columns not clear and also not necessary for this analysis)\n5 of the original columns were decoded into 11 additional columns:\nWind is decoded into\nWind_Direction\nWind_Speed_Tenths\nWind_Speed_Quality\nWind_Speed_Meters\nWind_Type\nTemperature is decoded into\nTemperature_Celsius\nTemperature_Quality\nSea_Level_Pressure_hPa is decoded into\nSea_Level_Pressure_hPa\nSLP_Quality\nDew is decoded into 2 columns\nDew_Point_Celsius\nDew_Point_Quality\nDate was seperated to 2 columns\nDate\nTime\n\nData Cleaning Methods Employed\nColumn Selection\nOut of the original 25 columns, 9 were found to be missing chunks of data. These 9 columns were dropped using Python and importing Pandas as pd. I then fed the NCEI dataset into Python using “data = pd.read_csv(r’C:\\path_to_the_dataset_on_my PC. csv)”\nI used python to print the data column heads - print(data.head()))\nI had it print null data by “print(data.isnull().sum())\nI also had python drop the null columns “data_cleaned = data.dropna())\n    -   Total 9 columns were dropped.\nDecoding Encoded Data: Date Conversion\nConverted DATE Column to Datetime: The DATE column originally combined both dated and time. I split this into two separate columns by using the text to column function in excel.\nSea Level Pressure (SLP) Conversion Reformatted and Converted SLP: The SLP column contained values in string format with commas as delimiters. I decoded this using the Excel’s text to column function. The same method was used to decode the Wind, Temperature, and Dew variables.\nAdding visualization to quarto document, including label and captions.\nAdd a description of what we should understand from your visualization, and how this connect with your project scope.\n\nAbove Line plot models the relationship between the sea level pressure and time. Here’s my analysis:\n1. Initial Decline: The plot begins with a relatively steady but slow decrease in SLP during the first few months of 2024 (January through May).\n2. Sharp Increase: Around June, there is a significant, sharp increase in SLP, jumping to a much higher value.\n3. Plateau: After this large spike, the SLP seems to stabilize at a new elevated level, remaining constant through July and August.\nPossible Interpretation:\nThe initial period shows some minor fluctuations or a gradual decline in sea level pressure, which might indicate typical atmospheric conditions.\nThe sharp rise could suggest a sudden weather event or anomaly that caused a dramatic increase in pressure.\nThe stabilization afterward could be due to stable high-pressure systems or data issues (such as errors in recording or data entry).\nTemperature Over Time\n\nObserving the interaction between temperature and time reveals a general increase in temperature over time, however, above plot shows some extremely high temperature values . This suggests that there may be underlying issues with the data which might require further investigation of the dataset.\n\n\nWeek Two\n\n\n\nFriday\n\n\nAir Quality Data Analysis and Modeling Using Excel Pivot Chart\n\nData Type: CVS type, 154 entries and 6 columns.\nDataset Content: After cleaning the dataset contains 112 entries and 6 columns, representing the following variables:\nOzone: Ozone concentration (in parts per billion). Solar.R: Solar radiation (in Langley units). Wind: Wind speed (in miles per hour). Temp: Temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit). Month: Month of observation. Day: Day of the month.\nAll columns are complete with no missing values. The types of data are mostly integers, with wind speed recorded as a floating-point number.\nCleaning Method The dataset was cleaned exclusively using MS Excel. The Find and Replace function was employed to locate all instances of “N/A” and replace them with “0”. Afterward, a few test plots were generated, which revealed some deficiencies in the data. To address this, additional cleaning was performed by removing all rows containing “0” values.\nData Analysis Explore trends over time. Visualize correlations between temp, ozone level over time. Pivot tables were created from the dataset for analysis, and pivot charts were plotted for visualization.\nOzone and Temperature Correlation\n\n\nThis line chart shows the sum of Ozone levels, sum of Temperature, and sum of Days plotted against the Month. Here’s what can be inferred from the plot:\nB. Ozone Levels (Blue Line): Ozone levels fluctuates across the months. June shows a lower ozone level compared to July, where ozone levels peak. Ozone levels gradually decrease between July and September. This trend suggests that ozone levels are higher in July but decline towards the end of summer and into early fall.\nA. Temperature (Orange Line): Temperatures follow a rising trend from May to July, peaking in July. After peaking in July, the temperature decreases slightly in August, then increases again in Month September. This suggests that July tends to be the hottest month in the dataset, followed by slight variations in temperature in the following months.\nC. Day (Green Line): Days appear to be relatively consistent across the months, with only minor variations. This line indicates the total number of days contributing to the data for each is constant. This is an accurate visualization as the raw data shows data collected from 1st of each month to the last day.\nConclusion: The plot highlights a clear relationship between temperature and ozone levels, with both peaking in July. The consistent sum of days indicates uniform data collection across months. This pattern suggests that high summer temperatures contribute to higher ozone levels, which decline as temperatures drop towards the end of summer.\nTemperature and Wind Correlation\n\nThis combination chart displays the average temperature (bar chart) and the average wind speed (line chart) across the different months.\nA. Temperature Trends (Blue Bars): June and July have the highest average temperatures, both close to or exceeding 80 degrees. The months of May and September show relatively lower average temperatures compared to the peak summer months. Temperature is highest in July, indicating the middle of summer, and decreases slightly toward September.\nB. Wind Speed Trends (Orange Line): May starts with higher wind speeds, averaging around 10-12 mph.\nWind speeds are highest in June, with a slight drop in July, followed by relatively steady or slightly increasing wind speeds in August and September. July, which has the highest average temperature, coincides with lower wind speeds, indicating calm summer conditions.\nConclusion: The plot shows that July experiences the highest average temperatures but lower wind speeds, while June sees the highest wind speeds. This inverse trend between wind speed and temperature, especially during peak summer months, suggests that hotter conditions may coincide with calmer winds. This pattern could be typical of a warm season where high temperatures are associated with reduced wind activity.\nCombination bar chart of multiple variables across different months.\n\nKey Points Temperature and Solar Radiation: The high solar radiation levels in July and August correspond to higher average temperatures, which is typical for summer months.\nOzone and Temperature: Ozone levels are highest in July, suggesting that warmer temperatures lead to higher ozone concentrations, likely due to increased sunlight and heat contributing to ozone formation.\nWind Speed: Wind speeds are highest in the earlier months (May and June) but decrease in the peak summer months, which could imply calmer weather conditions during the hottest periods.\nConclusion: The chart visualization suggests a clear relationship between temperature, solar radiation, and ozone levels. As solar radiation and temperature increase during the summer months (especially in July), ozone levels also rise. Wind speeds, however, show an inverse relationship, with higher wind speeds occurring in the cooler months and lower wind speeds in the hotter summer months. This pattern is typical of mid-summer conditions, where higher temperatures and calmer winds create conditions conducive to higher ozone concentrations.\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\nTIME TO RECHECK DATA FOR ANOMALY!\n\nit was discovered that from row number 126 downwards, the dataset had been corrupted. I proceeded to remove these rows and ran the test again.\n\nSea_Level and Months.\n\nPIVOT TABLE CHALLENGE\nPivot Tables by default sum up the number formatted columns on the table. This plot, by doing, gave unrealistic figures of temperature values, rising to 35 thousand hpa. I revisted the Pivot table and changed the summation method to ‘average’ and the below plot is the result.\n\nThe new plot, with the average aggregation applied, provides a more accurate depiction of sea-level pressure trends over time. The values are within the expected range, and the daily fluctuations suggest typical atmospheric behavior. See below to information about atmospheric behaviour.\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/atmosphere/air-pressure#:~:text=Therefore%2C%201%20hectopascal%20(hPa),)%20and%20hectopascal%20(hPa).\nThe corrected Sea_level_Pressure Vs Date now looks like this:\n\nThe plot provides a better representation of how sea-level pressure changes over time. It also shows outliers in the dataset which warrant further investigation. Despite the outliers, the rest of the data appears to follow a consistent pattern showing typical fluctuations that could be linked to daily and seasonal atmospheric changes\nTemperature over time now looks like this:\n\nThe plot suggests a steady decrease in temperature over the 10-day period from December 31, 2023, to January 10, 2024. The temperatures drop from around -5°C to -30°C, likely due to seasonal winter progression. This trend matches in extreme cold weather proves the area the dataset reports as its origin, could be of interest in understanding the local climate patterns or preparing for extreme cold conditions;\nkjeller Airfield, Norway.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kjeller_Airfield\nThe plot also proves true about Norway’s weather in December/January. https://www.campervannorway.com/blog/travel-ideas/norway-in-january#:~:text=As%20a%20midwinter%20month%2C%20January,dry%20to%20rainy%20or%20snowy.",

    "section": "4.2 Wednesday Example",
    "text": "4.2 Wednesday Example\nIn Monday’s class, we learned how to identify cells, columns, and rows in an Excel worksheet. After completing the airquality example, we selected our own datasets. I chose the attenu dataset, which provides information on earthquake attenuation—how the strength of seismic waves decreases as they travel through the Earth. The Joyner–Boore Attenuation Data includes peak acceleration measurements from various observation stations for 23 California earthquakes. This dataset is commonly used to model how ground acceleration (the shaking during an earthquake) decreases with distance from the epicenter and is affected by the earthquake’s magnitude. It’s valuable for studying seismic wave behavior and predicting ground motion intensity at different distances from an earthquake. It uses five variables (Event, Magnitude, Station, Distance, and Acceleration) with 182 observations.\n\nEvent is the numeric Event Number.\nMag is the numeric Moment Magnitude.\nStation is the factor Station Number.\nDistance is the numeric Station-hypocenter distance (km).\nAcceleration is the numeric Peak acceleration (g).\n\n\n4.2.1 Basic Functions\nOnce the Excel worksheet is created and named correctly, we can start cleaning the data so we do not encounter any errors or make sure our visualizations make sense with the information we care about, taking outliers out or NAs. In this case, I removed all NAs in my data set by selecting the dataset, going to Data in the menu bar, choosing a filter, and checking NAs off. I also removed all the numbers that made no sense in a numeric column.\n\n\n4.2.2 Variables to be evaluated\nI will evaluate Magnitude and Distance to model how earthquake recordings vary with both the magnitude of the quake and the distance at which it is observed. In other words, how depending on the magnitude people further from the epicenter can still feel it.\n\n\n4.2.3 Scatter Plot\n\nIn this graph, the X-axis shows earthquake magnitude, ranging from about 4 to 8, while the Y-axis represents the distance from the earthquake epicenter in kilometers, going from 0 to 400. For higher magnitudes, the distances are more dispersed, with some data points reaching distances of 350 km or more. A positive relationship between magnitude and distance is suggested, as larger magnitudes correspond to a wider range of distances, indicating that stronger earthquakes may be detected at stations farther from the epicenter.\n\n\n4.2.4 Line Plot\n\nIn this chart, the X-axis is a sequence of data points associated with magnitude and distance values, while the Y-axis shows values for magnitude (in blue) and distance (in orange). We can observe how the distance fluctuates considerably, with peaks reaching up to 350 km, indicating that some earthquakes are recorded at distant stations, though many are detected closer to the epicenter. The magnitude line remains mostly flat along the bottom, suggesting that the magnitude values show little variation compared to the distance. However, we must consider that earthquake magnitudes above 4 can already cause damage. If we made them individual graphs it would reflect better the magnitude. And ultimately determine that higher magnitudes are felt in further locations. In this plot, the earthquakes seem to have relatively consistent magnitudes, likely within a narrow range, while the distance varies more significantly.\n\n\n4.2.5 Bar Chart\n\nIn this chart, the X-axis represents a sequence of data points linked to magnitude and distance values, while the Y-axis displays magnitude (in blue) and distance (in orange). The distance fluctuates significantly, with peaks up to 350 km, indicating that some earthquakes are recorded at distant stations, though many are detected closer to the epicenter. The magnitude line remains mostly flat near the bottom, showing minimal variation in magnitude compared to the distance. However, it’s important to note that magnitudes above 4 can still cause damage. Separate graphs for magnitude and distance would better highlight magnitude trends, showing that stronger earthquakes are often felt at greater distances. Overall, this chart reflects relatively consistent earthquake magnitudes, likely within a narrow range, while distances vary more substantially.\n\n\n4.2.6 Pie Chart\n\nThe pie chart visually displays the distribution of magnitude and distance values within the data set, with magnitude shown in blue and distance in orange. The largest slice represents distance, indicating it is the most frequent or dominant value. However, pie charts are not well-suited for our analysis, as they make it challenging to compare values and are not ideal for illustrating relationships between variables.\n\n\n4.2.7 Histogram\n\nThe histogram above analyzes the distribution of magnitudes across various distance ranges. The X-axis represents these distance ranges, divided into bins, while the Y-axis indicates the frequency of occurrences within each bin. The data reveals a higher frequency of observations in the lower distance ranges, with fewer observations as the distances increase. Most of the observations are concentrated within the first distance range (0.6, 42.6], suggesting that a significant portion of the data is clustered in this region. The presence of a long tail points to potential outliers or extreme values, which may require further investigation.",

However, most of the data points are located in clusters between 0 and 80 for ozone and between 60 and 100 for temperature.

    "text": "4.8 Pivot Table 2\n\nHere, we have a pivot table with ozone levels on the row label and average temperature on the column section. We are looking into the average temperature in the different groups of ozone levels. I made the groups by selecting the desired range, right-clicking, and selecting the group. Group 1 has (1,24) ozone level, and Group 2 has (27,50), Group 3 (52,76), Group 4 (77,97), and Group 5 (108,168). We can observe the temperature correlation whenever the ozone levels are from 1 to 25 and so on. The table shows us that the average temperature is higher in the (77,97) range.",

    "text": "4.11 Pivot Table 5\n\nThis pivot table analyzes the relationship between wind speed and temperature to explore potential correlations. Wind speeds range from around 1.7 to 20.7 units, while temperatures vary between 57° and 94°, indicating substantial fluctuation across different wind speeds. A general pattern suggests that temperatures tend to decrease as wind speeds rise. However, exceptions to this trend imply that other factors may also impact temperature.",

    "text": "4.12 Midterm Dataset\n\n4.12.1 Source\nAfter selecting the dataset from the list provided in class, I entered the link under source, which led me to the epa.gov webpage.\n\n\n4.12.2 Finding the Dataset\nI scrolled down, and in the website’s footer, under connect, I selected the option called Data. EPA data is organized by topic to help users find the necessary information.\nThe topic I selected is air, which goes over air quality data from stationary and mobile sources to protect public health and public welfare.\n(You may also find the data by searching datasets in the lookup section and selecting “Air Data Air Quality Data Collected at Outdoor Monitors Across the US.”)\n\n\n4.12.3 Downloading the Data\nOnce you choose the topic, we go to the “Download Data” section and select “Download Daily Data.” Here, you will find a tool that queries daily air quality summary statistics for the criteria pollutants by monitor. You can get data for specific monitors or all monitors in a city, county, or state.\nThe pollutant I chose was ozone, and the year I selected it was 2023. The geographic area is Florida. The cities to be considered are Miami,Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. Specifically in the Miami-Dade county. I selected All Sites and clicked “Get Data,” which downloaded an Excel file.\n\n\n4.12.4 About the Dataset (Summary)\nThe topic I chose is Airquality focused on air pollutant, specifically ozone. Ozone is a harmful gas formed when pollutants from vehicles, industries, and other sources react with sunlight. We will look into the levels in Florida, Miami,Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach. Specifically in the Miami-Dade county. There are 21 variables in this dataset and 710 observations.\n\nDate refers to the date on which air quality measurements were taken.\nSource refers to the origin or provider of the air quality measurements.\nSite ID represents a unique identifier for a specific monitoring location or station where the air quality measurements are collected.\nPOC is the numeric Event Number.\nDaily Max 8-hour Ozone Concentration refers to the highest average ozone concentration measured over an 8-hour period within a single day.\nUnits indicates the measurement units used for the various air quality parameters recorded in the dataset.It is measured in parts per million (ppm).\nDaily AQI Value refers to the Air Quality Index (AQI) value calculated for a specific day.The AQI is a numerical scale used to communicate the quality of the air in terms of how it affects health.\nLocal Site Name refers to the specific name or designation given to the monitoring location or station where the air quality measurements are taken.\nDaily Obs Count refers to the number of observations or measurements taken for a specific air quality parameter on a given day.\nPercent Complete indicates the proportion of data that is available and valid for a given parameter or time period compared to the total amount of expected data.\nAQS Parameter code is a unique identifier used by the Air Quality System (AQS) to categorize and specify different air quality parameters measured in the dataset.\nAQS Parameter Description it provides a textual description of the air quality parameter associated with a specific AQS Parameter Code.\nMethod Code refers to a unique identifier assigned to a specific method or technique used for measuring an air quality parameter.\nCBSA Code it stands for Core Based Statistical Area Code. It is a unique identifier used in the United States to designate specific geographic areas defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for statistical purposes.\nCBSA Name refers to the descriptive name of a Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA).\nState FIPS Code i is a numeric code assigned to each U.S. state and federal district by the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).\nState refers to the U.S. state or jurisdiction where the air quality measurements were collected.\nCounty FIPS Code it is a numeric code assigned to each county or equivalent jurisdiction within a state by the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).\nCounty refers to the specific county or equivalent administrative region where the air quality measurements were taken.\nSite Latitude refers to the geographical latitude coordinate of the monitoring site.\nSite Longitude refers to the geographical longitude coordinate of the monitoring site.\n\n\n\n4.12.5 Cleaning Data\nI went over the Excel document and did not observe any NA values. I did however, encounter some blank cells in the Method Code. All the cells had the number 47 but I chose to delete those that did not have any method listed since I did not want to assume.\nI removed all NAs in my data set by selecting the dataset, going to Data in the menu bar, choosing a filter, and checking NAs off.\n\n\n4.12.6 Variables to evaluate\nThe variables I will consider are Daily AQI Value and Local Site Name. Our goal is to analyze the air quality by location.\n\n\n4.12.7 Scatter Plot\n\n\n4.12.8 Line Plot\n\n\n4.12.9 Bar Chart\n\n\n4.12.10 Pie Chart\n\n\n4.12.11 Histogram",
