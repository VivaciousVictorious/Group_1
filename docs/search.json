    "text": "5.1 Week 1 submissision\n\n5.1.1 Monday Excel Tutorial\nIn Monday’s class, we learned how to identify cells, columns, and rows in an Excel worksheet.\n\nCells are the basic unit of Excel where you enter data. Each cell is identified by a unique address combining the column letter and row number.\nColumns are the vertical sets of cells labeled with letters.\nRows are the horizontal sets of cells labeled with numbers.\n\nSome of the essential Excel functions we learned about are the following:\n\nSUM is the function that adds all the numbers in a range of cells.\nAVERAGE is the function that calculates the average of numbers in a range.\nMAX is the function that finds the maximum value in a range.\nMIN is the function that finds the minimum value in a range.\n\nThe formula for all previous functions is = before the function and a parenthesis containing the cells. Ex: =SUM(A5:B5)\n\n\n5.1.2 Basic Functions\nOnce the Excel worksheet is created and named correctly, we can start cleaning the data so we do not encounter any errors or make sure our visualizations make sense with the information we care about, taking outliers out or NAs. In this case, I removed all NAs in my data set by selecting the dataset, going to Data in the menu bar, choosing a filter, and checking NAs off.\n\n\n5.1.3 Scatter Plot\nI created a scatter plot by selecting the data, clicking insert in the menu bar, and selecting scatter plot in recommended charts.\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Line Plot\nI created a line plot by selecting the data, clicking insert in the menu bar, and selecting line plots in recommended charts.\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Bar Chart\nI created a bar chart by selecting the data, clicking insert in the menu bar, and selecting bar chart in recommended charts.\n\n\n\n5.1.6 Pie Chart\nI created a pie chart by selecting the data, clicking Insert in the menu bar, and selecting pie charts from the recommended charts.\n\n\n\n5.1.7 Histogram\nI created a Histogram by selecting the data, clicking insert in the menu bar, and selecting Histogram in recommended charts.",

With these charts, we can understand the data and observe all the characteristics in an organized way using color. The other graphs are more complex to understand, and it is challenging to recognize repeated numbers and consider them individually, which makes the chart too broad.",

It also reveals most data points are clustered around the temperature range of 60/90 degrees and wind speed of 5/15 units, this indicates common wind and temperature within the sampled area.\nThe downward trend suggests that higher wind speeds tend to be associated with lower temperatures, but the variability in the data indicates that this is not the only factor affecting temperature.\nScatter plot seem best for visualizing relationships, below plot reveals the Ozone levels across different temperature ranges.\n\n\nThe plot reveals a generally positive relationship between temperature and ozone levels, with higher temperatures leading to higher ozone levels. The presence of an outlier suggests that under certain conditions, ozone levels can spike significantly, which may require further investigation to understand the underlying causes. The outlier might be a result of wrong calculation, error in transferring of data or a weather anomaly. At any rate, further investigation will be required to reach a conclusive decision.\n\nOzone distribution was also recorded to visualize Ozone concentration in the dataset.\n\n\nThe histogram shows that low ozone concentrations are the most common in the dataset, while higher concentrations are much less frequent. This right-skewed distribution suggests that most observations are clustered at lower ozone levels, with only a few instances of higher concentrations that could be outliers or represent unusual conditions.\n\nCloser analysis of concentration intervals:\n[0, 22]: This first interval has the highest frequency, with around 80 observations. This suggests that most ozone levels in the dataset are quite low.\n[22, 44] and [44, 66]: The frequency decreases significantly in these intervals, showing that moderate ozone levels are less common but still present.\n[66, 88] and above: The number of occurrences in these intervals continues to drop, indicating that high ozone levels are uncommon.\nThe highest intervals, [132, 154] and [154, 176], have almost no observations, confirming that extreme ozone levels are rare.\n\n\nI assumed there must exit a relationship between solar radiation and season, so i tried to module this relationship with a bar chart:\n\n\nIt made no sense. So i tried with a pivot bar chart:\n\nThe chart indicates that solar radiation peaks during the summer months, particularly in July, which aligns with typical seasonal patterns. These are the summer months where countries experience longer day light, stronger sunlight which typically leads to higher solar radiation emissions.\nThe presence of the “(blank)” bar suggests that are some missing data which resulted from cleaning the dataset and replacing ‘0’ value where ‘NA’ were otherwise recorded, specially in the solar.r data.\nOverall, the chart helps visualize how solar radiation varies throughout the year, highlighting the expected seasonal changes in sunlight exposure.\n\nWhat plot do you think represents the better data? The Pivot Chart followed by the Scatter Plot. For the purpose of the weeks lessons i will choose the Scatter Plot that models the relationship between temperature and windspeed.\nWhy? It gives for easy calculation, it depicts the best fit line for regression calculation, the different occurrences in the dataset; displaying what data cluster looks like, negative correlation and outliers. This chart could be easily chosen to teach basic statistics. However, with the Pivot Chart, it is easy to read and understand straightaway and interpret what the chart is inferring but will not be chosen to teach intro to statistics or Excel in R.\n\n\n\n\nClick to expand",

It will be used to understand how student experience learning, how they rank their school/university, lecturers performance and opportunity for growth or continuing in higher ed within the same school.\nAnalyzing this data can help in understanding the factors that influence students attitudes towards a school and identifying areas for improvement within that school.\nDataset Variables:\n\nRating: This is the overall score or satisfaction rating given by students, perhaps based on their experience at the school.\nComplaints: Represents the number of complaints or grievances filed by students, possibly indicating dissatisfaction or issues in the school environment.\nPrivileges: Refer to the benefits or perks that certain students receive, such as the gtsnts, scholarship, PhD student privileges, or other library/sports privileges.\nLearning: Opportunities for learning and practicum, like training programs or skill enhancement opportunities available to students within certain discipline.\nRaises: Indicates how frequently or generously students receive privileges. This could be tied to grades. Students are giving raises according to their academic performances.\nCritical: This measure how critical or demanding the work load on the students are, possibly reflecting the level of pressure or stress students undergo to get these privileges.\nAdvance: Indicates opportunities for advancement within the university, showing how easy or difficult it is for students to become professors.\n\nData Modelling and Visualization\nRelationship between Rating and Raises\n\n\nThe scatter plot indicates that there is an upward trend, that is, higher ratings are often associated with higher raises. Meaning that students who receive grants and scholarships tend to rate their university experience positively and vice versa.\nMost of the data points are clustered in certain areas of the plot, particularly where the ratings and raises are both mid to high. This could mean that majority of students who receive reasonable raises are also moderately to highly satisfied.\nInterpretation\n\nThe positive correlations suggests that raises might be tied to performance or satisfaction. Students with higher marks may receive better raises as a form of reward.\nConversely, receiving scholarship and grants could incentivize a students to earn higher grade.\n\n\n\nDistribution of Learning Scores\n\n\n\nThe histogram reveals that learning scores are distributed across the dataset with most scores centered around the median indicating that most students have similar learning experiences.\nMajority of learning scores fall within the middle range, around the median of 55.5, which suggests that most students rate their learning opportunities similarly, neither extremely high nor low.\nInterpretation\n\nThe histogram shows that the university might have a consistent approach to offering learning opportunities, as most are centered around the middle.\nOn a good note, since the data is not heavily skewed, it means there might be room for improvement.\n\nCorrelation Between Complaints and Privileges\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot points are somewhat dispersed around the trend line, meaning that while there’s a general trend showing a positive correlation between complaints and privileges, the correlation isn’t very strong. Some points might be far above or below the trend line, indicating instances where the number of complaints and the level of privileges do not follow the general pattern. This variability suggests that other factors might be influencing the relationship, or that the correlation between complaints and privileges is moderate rather than strong.\nConclusion:\n\nThe dataset reflects complex relationships where certain metrics correlate positively with outcomes like privileges and raises. However, these relationships are not straightforward, indicating the presence of other influencing factors.\nThe distribution of scores and the variability observed suggest diverse performance levels and outcomes within the data, hinting at the need for further detailed analysis to uncover underlying drivers.\n\n\nWhat plot do you think represents the better data? The distribution of learning across the dataset.\nWhy? The histogram depicts the distribution learning scores accurately, it holds several information; for instance, certain score ranges are more common which indicates varying levels of difficulty or achievement among the participants. This could so by the school of departments design. It could be that convergence of performance around mean is due to standardized assessments or common learning patterns which most students have come to expect or most students understood the topics more than other topics.\nReported the findings in - excel-basics_Attitude_Fashina_082624.",
