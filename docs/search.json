After completing the airquality example, we selected our own datasets. I chose the attenu dataset, which provides information on earthquake attenuation—how the strength of seismic waves decreases as they travel through the Earth. The Joyner–Boore Attenuation Data includes peak acceleration measurements from various observation stations for 23 California earthquakes. This dataset is commonly used to model how ground acceleration (the shaking during an earthquake) decreases with distance from the epicenter and is affected by the earthquake’s magnitude. It’s valuable for studying seismic wave behavior and predicting ground motion intensity at different distances from an earthquake. It uses five variables (Event, Magnitude, Station, Distance, and Acceleration) with 182 observations.\n\nEvent is the numeric Event Number.\nMag is the numeric Moment Magnitude.\nStation is the factor Station Number.\nDistance is the numeric Station-hypocenter distance (km).\nAcceleration is the numeric Peak acceleration (g).",

Starting with the variable solar radiation, the graphs show that the month with the highest level of this variable was month 5, being at 334. For the rest of the months we see how it declines, with month 6 of 323, month 7 of 314, month 8 of 273, and month 9 259.\nNext is the variable temperature. Even though in the last chart the month with the highest averagre temperature was month 7, month 8 had the highest temperature in the month. And the month with the lowest temperature was month 5.\nUp next is the variable of wind. And when we take a look to the information of the charts, it shows an interesting correlation between the other variables. If we see the month with the lowest wind rate is 7, being 14.90. In the char above, the month with the highest average temperature is also month 7, which this tells us that less wind could mean a higher temperature.\nThe last variable in the chart is the ozone. For this variable it is interesting that over these months the ozone variables were completely different from each other.\n\n\n3.4.2 Sum temp, Ozone, Wind, Solar R. by Month\n\n\nThis table presents the monthly totals for four environmental variables: temperature (Temp), ozone (Ozone), wind (Wind), and solar radiation (Solar.R), across a 5-month period (May to September). Here’s an analysis of the data:\n\n\n3.4.3 Temperature (Temp)\nHighest Temp: July recorded the highest temperature with 2181. This suggests that July had the warmest weather in this period.\nLowest Temp: June had the lowest temperature at 704. This could indicate cooler conditions in early summer.\nTrend: There is a noticeable increase from June to July, followed by relatively high values in August and September, suggesting a warmer late summer/early fall season.\nTotal: The sum across all months is 8635, showing that the overall temperature peaks in mid-summer and declines toward the fall.\n\n\n3.4.4 Ozone\nHighest Ozone: July again stands out, with the highest ozone level at 1537. This could be related to high summer temperatures that tend to drive ozone formation.\nLowest Ozone: June has the lowest total ozone at 265, possibly due to cooler weather or less pollution.\nTrend: Ozone increases significantly from May to July, then decreases in August and September, showing that the peak of ozone corresponds to the peak summer month.\nTotal: The overall ozone total is 4673.\n\n\n3.4.5 Wind\nHighest Wind: The highest total wind value is recorded in September at 292.2, likely indicating stronger winds as the season transitions to autumn.\nLowest Wind: June has the lowest wind total at 109.6, possibly reflecting more stable atmospheric conditions.\nTrend: Wind totals fluctuate across the months, with no consistent pattern, except for a noticeable rise in September.\nTotal: The sum for wind across all months is 1103.3.\n\n\n3.4.6 Solar Radiation\nHighest Solar Radiation: July again shows the highest solar radiation total at 5627, reflecting the peak summer sunshine.\nLowest Solar Radiation: June has the lowest total solar radiation at 1658, which may be due to fewer daylight hours or cloudier weather.\nTrend: There’s a steady rise from June to July, followed by a decline in August and September, mirroring the seasonal solar cycle.\nTotal: The overall solar radiation for the period is 20,513, with most of it occurring in the mid-summer months.\n\n\n3.4.7 Min temp, Ozone, Wind, Solar R. by Month\n\n\nTemperature: The lowest temperature in May is 57°F, increasing gradually through the summer months, peaking at 73°F in July, and slightly dropping to 63°F in September.\nTrend: Temperatures rise in early summer (June, July) and decline by September.\nOzone: The lowest ozone concentration varies, starting very low in May (1 unit), peaking at 12 units in June, and stabilizing around 7-9 units during the rest of the months.\nTrend: A sharp increase in June, followed by relatively stable levels.\nWind: Wind speed declines progressively from May (5.7 mph) to September (2.8 mph).\nTrend: Wind speed shows a steady decline over the summer.\nSolar Radiation: It is at its lowest in May (8 units) and fluctuates across the months, reaching a peak in June (37 units) and settling around mid-range values (7-24 units) in other months.\nTrend: A significant spike in June, with more stable values before and after.",

This suggests that July had the warmest weather in this period.\nLowest Temp: June had the lowest temperature at 704. This could indicate cooler conditions in early summer.\nTrend: There is a noticeable increase from June to July, followed by relatively high values in August and September, suggesting a warmer late summer/early fall season.\nTotal: The sum across all months is 8635, showing that the overall temperature peaks in mid-summer and declines toward the fall.\n\n\n3.6.2 Ozone\nHighest Ozone: July again stands out, with the highest ozone level at 1537. This could be related to high summer temperatures that tend to drive ozone formation.\nLowest Ozone: June has the lowest total ozone at 265, possibly due to cooler weather or less pollution.\nTrend: Ozone increases significantly from May to July, then decreases in August and September, showing that the peak of ozone corresponds to the peak summer month.\nTotal: The overall ozone total is 4673.\n\n\n3.6.3 Wind\nHighest Wind: The highest total wind value is recorded in September at 292.2, likely indicating stronger winds as the season transitions to autumn.\nLowest Wind: June has the lowest wind total at 109.6, possibly reflecting more stable atmospheric conditions.\nTrend: Wind totals fluctuate across the months, with no consistent pattern, except for a noticeable rise in September.\nTotal: The sum for wind across all months is 1103.3.\n\n\n3.6.4 Solar Radiation\nHighest Solar Radiation: July again shows the highest solar radiation total at 5627, reflecting the peak summer sunshine.\nLowest Solar Radiation: June has the lowest total solar radiation at 1658, which may be due to fewer daylight hours or cloudier weather.\nTrend: There’s a steady rise from June to July, followed by a decline in August and September, mirroring the seasonal solar cycle.\nTotal: The overall solar radiation for the period is 20,513, with most of it occurring in the mid-summer months.",

And when we take a look to the information of the charts, it shows an interesting correlation between the other variables. If we see the month with the lowest wind rate is 7, being 14.90. In the char above, the month with the highest average temperature is also month 7, which this tells us that less wind could mean a higher temperature.\nThe last variable in the chart is the ozone.

A positive relationship between magnitude and distance is suggested, as larger magnitudes correspond to a wider range of distances, indicating that stronger earthquakes may be detected at stations farther from the epicenter.\n\n\n4.4.3 Line Plot\n\nIn this chart, the X-axis is a sequence of data points associated with magnitude and distance values, while the Y-axis shows values for magnitude (in blue) and distance (in orange). We can observe how the distance fluctuates considerably, with peaks reaching up to 350 km, indicating that some earthquakes are recorded at distant stations, though many are detected closer to the epicenter. The magnitude line remains mostly flat along the bottom, suggesting that the magnitude values show little variation compared to the distance. However, we must consider that earthquake magnitudes above 4 can already cause damage. If we made them individual graphs it would reflect better the magnitude. And ultimately determine that higher magnitudes are felt in further locations. In this plot, the earthquakes seem to have relatively consistent magnitudes, likely within a narrow range, while the distance varies more significantly.\n\n\n4.4.4 Bar Chart\n\nIn this chart, the X-axis represents a sequence of data points linked to magnitude and distance values, while the Y-axis displays magnitude (in blue) and distance (in orange). The distance fluctuates significantly, with peaks up to 350 km, indicating that some earthquakes are recorded at distant stations, though many are detected closer to the epicenter. The magnitude line remains mostly flat near the bottom, showing minimal variation in magnitude compared to the distance. However, it’s important to note that magnitudes above 4 can still cause damage. Separate graphs for magnitude and distance would better highlight magnitude trends, showing that stronger earthquakes are often felt at greater distances. Overall, this chart reflects relatively consistent earthquake magnitudes, likely within a narrow range, while distances vary more substantially.\n\n\n4.4.5 Pie Chart\n\nThe pie chart visually displays the distribution of magnitude and distance values within the data set, with magnitude shown in blue and distance in orange. The largest slice represents distance, indicating it is the most frequent or dominant value. However, pie charts are not well-suited for our analysis, as they make it challenging to compare values and are not ideal for illustrating relationships between variables.\n\n\n4.4.6 Histogram\n\nThe histogram above analyzes the distribution of magnitudes across various distance ranges. The X-axis represents these distance ranges, divided into bins, while the Y-axis indicates the frequency of occurrences within each bin. The data reveals a higher frequency of observations in the lower distance ranges, with fewer observations as the distances increase. Most of the observations are concentrated within the first distance range (0.6, 42.6], suggesting that a significant portion of the data is clustered in this region. The presence of a long tail points to potential outliers or extreme values, which may require further investigation.",

    "text": "7.3 Data Modelling and Visualization\nRelationship between Rating and Raises\n\n\nThe scatter plot indicates that there is an upward trend, that is, higher ratings are often associated with higher raises. Meaning that students who receive grants and scholarships tend to rate their university experience positively and vice versa.\nMost of the data points are clustered in certain areas of the plot, particularly where the ratings and raises are both mid to high. This could mean that majority of students who receive reasonable raises are also moderately to highly satisfied.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe positive correlations suggests that raises might be tied to performance or satisfaction. Students with higher marks may receive better raises as a form of reward.\nConversely, receiving scholarship and grants could incentivize a student to earn higher grade.\n\nDistribution of Learning Scores\n\nThe histogram reveals that learning scores are distributed across the dataset with most scores centered around the median indicating that most students have similar learning experiences.\nMajority of learning scores fall within the middle range, around the median of 55.5, which suggests that most students rate their learning opportunities similarly, neither extremely high nor low.\nInterpretation\nThe histogram shows that the university might have a consistent approach to offering learning opportunities, as most are centered around the middle.\nOn a good note, since the data is not heavily skewed, it means there might be room for improvement.\nCorrelation Between Complaints and Privileges\n\nThe scatter plot points are somewhat dispersed around the trend line, meaning that while there’s a general trend showing a positive correlation between complaints and privileges, the correlation isn’t very strong. Some points might be far above or below the trend line, indicating instances where the number of complaints and the level of privileges do not follow the general pattern. This variability suggests that other factors might be influencing the relationship, or that the correlation between complaints and privileges is moderate rather than strong.\nConclusion:\n\nThe dataset reflects complex relationships where certain metrics correlate positively with outcomes like privileges and raises. However, these relationships are not straightforward, indicating the presence of other influencing factors.\nThe distribution of scores and the variability observed suggest diverse performance levels and outcomes within the data, hinting at the need for further detailed analysis to uncover underlying drivers.\n\nWhat plot do you think represents the better data? The distribution of learning across the dataset.\nWhy? The histogram depicts the distribution learning scores accurately, it holds several information; for instance, certain score ranges are more common which indicates varying levels of difficulty or achievement among the participants. This could so by the school of departments design. It could be that convergence of performance around mean is due to standardized assessments or common learning patterns which most students have come to expect or most students understood the topics more than other topics.\nReported the findings in - excel-basics_Attitude_Fashina_082624.",

    "text": "6.3 Add the method used and the following information to your quarto report:\nThe context of the dataset\nThe dataset is a collection of meteorological observations from a specific weather station identified as “KJELLER AIRPORT, NO”. This dataset is used by the National Center For Environmental Information (NCEI) for studying weather trends, creating predictive models, or understanding how atmospheric conditions change over time.\nBased on the column names and data structure, the dataset consists of:\n1. Geographical Information: - STATION, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, ELEVATION: These columns provide details about the specific location where the weather observations were recorded.\n2. Time-based Observations: - Date/Time: The dataset records weather data at hourly intervals, providing a time-series structure for analyzing weather patterns.\n3. Meteorological Data: - SLP (Sea Level Pressure): Atmospheric pressure at sea level, which is useful in studying weather systems, such as predicting storm conditions or high-pressure systems. - WND, TMP, VIS, DEW, etc.: These columns seem to encode data on wind speed/direction, temperature, visibility, dew point, and other weather-related variables. They are stored in a format that requires further decoding.\n4. Purpose: - It would appear that the is used for tracking and analyzing weather conditions over time at the specified station. It could be useful for forecasting, climate studies, or aviation-related weather monitoring.\nThe source and link to the dataset - (csv)\n\nThe source is National Centre For Environment Information (NCEI)\nhttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/access/2024/01466099999.csv\nName : 2024-08-26 10:32 - 93K\nOriginal dataset consists of 301 rows and 25 columns.\nCleaned dataset consists of 301 rows and 28 columns.\n9 columns were deleted(correlation with other columns not clear and also not necessary for this analysis)\n5 of the original columns were decoded into 11 additional columns:\nWind is decoded into\nWind_Direction\nWind_Speed_Tenths\nWind_Speed_Quality\nWind_Speed_Meters\nWind_Type\nTemperature is decoded into\nTemperature_Celsius\nTemperature_Quality\nSea_Level_Pressure_hPa is decoded into\nSea_Level_Pressure_hPa\nSLP_Quality\nDew is decoded into 2 columns\nDew_Point_Celsius\nDew_Point_Quality\nDate was seperated to 2 columns\nDate\nTime\n\n\n6.3.1 Data Cleaning Methods Employed\n###Column Selection\nOut of the original 25 columns, 9 were found to be missing chunks of data. These 9 columns were dropped using Python and importing Pandas as pd. I then fed the NCEI dataset into Python using “data = pd.read_csv(r’C:\\path_to_the_dataset_on_my PC. csv)”\nI used python to print the data column heads - print(data.head()))\nI had it print null data by “print(data.isnull().sum())\nI also had python drop the null columns “data_cleaned = data.dropna())\n-   Total 9 columns were dropped.\nDecoding Encoded Data: Date Conversion\nConverted DATE Column to Datetime: The DATE column originally combined both dated and time. I split this into two separate columns by using the text to column function in excel.\nSea Level Pressure (SLP) Conversion Reformatted and Converted SLP: The SLP column contained values in string format with commas as delimiters. I decoded this using the Excel’s text to column function. The same method was used to decode the Wind, Temperature, and Dew variables.\nAdding visualization to quarto document, including label and captions.\nAdd a description of what we should understand from your visualization, and how this connect with your project scope.\n\nAbove Line plot models the relationship between the sea level pressure and time. Here’s my analysis:\n1. Initial Decline: The plot begins with a relatively steady but slow decrease in SLP during the first few months of 2024 (January through May).\n2. Sharp Increase: Around June, there is a significant, sharp increase in SLP, jumping to a much higher value.\n3. Plateau: After this large spike, the SLP seems to stabilize at a new elevated level, remaining constant through July and August.\nPossible Interpretation:\nThe initial period shows some minor fluctuations or a gradual decline in sea level pressure, which might indicate typical atmospheric conditions.\nThe sharp rise could suggest a sudden weather event or anomaly that caused a dramatic increase in pressure.\nThe stabilization afterward could be due to stable high-pressure systems or data issues (such as errors in recording or data entry).\nTemperature Over Time\n\nObserving the interaction between temperature and time reveals a general increase in temperature over time, however, above plot shows some extremely high temperature values . This suggests that there may be underlying issues with the data which might require further investigation of the dataset.",

It also reveals most data points are clustered around the temperature range of 60/90 degrees and wind speed of 5/15 units, this indicates common wind and temperature within the sampled area.\nThe downward trend suggests that higher wind speeds tend to be associated with lower temperatures, but the variability in the data indicates that this is not the only factor affecting temperature.\nScatter plot seem best for visualizing relationships, below plot reveals the Ozone levels across different temperature ranges.\n\nThe plot reveals a generally positive relationship between temperature and ozone levels, with higher temperatures leading to higher ozone levels. The presence of an outlier suggests that under certain conditions, ozone levels can spike significantly, which may require further investigation to understand the underlying causes. The outlier might be a result of wrong calculation, error in transferring of data or a weather anomaly. At any rate, further investigation will be required to reach a conclusive decision.\n\nOzone distribution was also recorded to visualize Ozone concentration in the dataset.\n\n\nThe histogram shows that low ozone concentrations are the most common in the dataset, while higher concentrations are much less frequent. This right-skewed distribution suggests that most observations are clustered at lower ozone levels, with only a few instances of higher concentrations that could be outliers or represent unusual conditions.\n\n\n7.1.2 Closer analysis of concentration intervals:\n\n[0, 22]: This first interval has the highest frequency, with around 80 observations. This suggests that most ozone levels in the dataset are quite low.\n[22, 44] and [44, 66]: The frequency decreases significantly in these intervals, showing that moderate ozone levels are less common but still present.\n[66, 88] and above: The number of occurrences in these intervals continues to drop, indicating that high ozone levels are uncommon.\nThe highest intervals, [132, 154] and [154, 176], have almost no observations, confirming that extreme ozone levels are rare.\n\nI assumed there must exit a relationship between solar radiation and season, so i tried to module this relationship with a bar chart:\n\nIt made no sense. So i tried with a pivot bar chart:\n\nThe chart indicates that solar radiation peaks during the summer months, particularly in July, which aligns with typical seasonal patterns. These are the summer months where countries experience longer day light, stronger sunlight which typically leads to higher solar radiation emissions.\nThe presence of the “(blank)” bar suggests that are some missing data which resulted from cleaning the dataset and replacing ‘0’ value where ‘NA’ were otherwise recorded, specially in the solar.r data.\nOverall, the chart helps visualize how solar radiation varies throughout the year, highlighting the expected seasonal changes in sunlight exposure.\n\nWhat plot do you think represents the better data? The Pivot Chart followed by the Scatter Plot. For the purpose of the weeks lessons i will choose the Scatter Plot that models the relationship between temperature and windspeed.\nWhy? It gives for easy calculation, it depicts the best fit line for regression calculation, the different occurrences in the dataset; displaying what data cluster looks like, negative correlation and outliers. This chart could be easily chosen to teach basic statistics. However, with the Pivot Chart, it is easy to read and understand straightaway and interpret what the chart is inferring but will not be chosen to teach intro to statistics or Excel in R.",

To enhance customization, I used Tableau’s options to drag variables into elements such as size, color, or shape. If I was unsure which graph type to use, Tableau’s “Show Me” feature offered a range of suggestions for visualizing the data effectively.I used filters and parameters in cases where the graphs were too long.\nSet Columns and Rows: When building the graphs, I placed string (categorical) values in the columns and numerical values in the rows. This arrangement helped structure the data to tell a clear and coherent story. I always double-checked that the information was logically presented and visually meaningful.\nRepeat for Multiple Graphs: I repeated the process, creating at least four visualizations to gain a well-rounded data perspective. This ensured that my dashboard displayed diverse insights.\nCreate the Dashboard: Once all my visualizations were ready, I clicked the dashboard button next to the sheet number to start building the dashboard. I customized its size by adjusting the height and width to match the desired layout.\nOrganize the Sheets: I dragged each graph sheet into the dashboard workspace, carefully arranging and organizing them into a clear, easy-to-navigate structure. I made sure the layout was logical and visually appealing.\nPublish and Share: I published the dashboard once I was satisfied with the final design. After publishing it, I clicked the “Share” button and copied the link to distribute or present the dashboard to others.\n\nThe types of charts I used are bubble chart, bar chart, scatter plot, and line graph.",

    "text": "4.22 Dashboard\nTo create a dashboard in Tableau, I followed these steps:\n\nBuild and customize the graphs: I started by creating a graph. Once I was satisfied with the first one, I duplicated it, modified the variables, and adjusted the graph type to suit my needs. I dragged the variables into elements like size, color, or shape for further customization. When unsure about the best graph type to use, Tableau provides suggestions through the “Show Me” feature, which offers additional visualization options. I used filters and parameters in cases where the graphs were too long.\nUse columns and rows: When setting up the graph, I tried placing string (categorical) values in the columns and numerical values in the rows. This layout often helps to ensure the visualization tells a coherent story. I then check if the data makes sense, both visually and contextually.\nRepeat for multiple graphs: After completing one graph, I repeated the process to create at least four different visualizations. This provided a diverse set of insights for the dashboard.\nCreate the dashboard: Once all my graphs were ready, I clicked the dashboard button located next to the sheet number. In this view, you can adjust the height and width of your dashboard to your desired dimensions.\nDrag and Organize Sheets: I dragged the sheets with graphs into the dashboard workspace. Then, I arrange and organize them to create a clean, logical layout.\nPublish and Share: I published the dashboard when I was happy with the final design. After publishing, I clicked the “Share” button and copied the provided link to distribute my work.\n\nThe types of charts I used are map, scatter plot, bar chart, and area chart.",

    "text": "7.7 Visualization Of National Centers For Environmental Information (NCEI) Dataset\n\n7.7.1 context of the dataset\nThe dataset is a collection of meteorological observations from a specific weather station identified as “KJELLER AIRPORT, NO”. This dataset is used by the National Center For Environmental Information (NCEI) for studying weather trends, creating predictive models, or understanding how atmospheric conditions change over time.\nBased on the column names and data structure, the dataset consists of:\n1. Geographical Information: - STATION, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, ELEVATION: These columns provide details about the specific location where the weather observations were recorded.\n2. Time-based Observations: - Date/Time: The dataset records weather data at hourly intervals, providing a time-series structure for analyzing weather patterns.\n3. Meteorological Data: - SLP (Sea Level Pressure): Atmospheric pressure at sea level, which is useful in studying weather systems, such as predicting storm conditions or high-pressure systems. - WND, TMP, VIS, DEW, etc.: These columns seem to encode data on wind speed/direction, temperature, visibility, dew point, and other weather-related variables. They are stored in a format that requires further decoding.\n4. Purpose: - It would appear that the is used for tracking and analyzing weather conditions over time at the specified station. It could be useful for forecasting, climate studies, or aviation-related weather monitoring.\n\n\n7.7.2 The source and link to the dataset - (csv)\n\nThe source is National Centre For Environment Information (NCEI)\nhttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/access/2024/01466099999.csv\nName : 2024-08-26 10:32 - 93K\nOriginal dataset consists of 301 rows and 25 columns.\nCleaned dataset consists of 301 rows and 28 columns.\n9 columns were deleted(correlation with other columns not clear and also not necessary for this analysis)\n5 of the original columns were decoded into 11 additional columns:\nWind is decoded into\nWind_Direction\nWind_Speed_Tenths\nWind_Speed_Quality\nWind_Speed_Meters\nWind_Type\nTemperature is decoded into\nTemperature_Celsius\nTemperature_Quality\nSea_Level_Pressure_hPa is decoded into\nSea_Level_Pressure_hPa\nSLP_Quality\nDew is decoded into 2 columns\nDew_Point_Celsius\nDew_Point_Quality\nDate was seperated to 2 columns\nDate\nTime\n\n\n\n7.7.3 Data Cleaning Methods Employed\n\n\n7.7.4 Column Selection\nOut of the original 25 columns, 9 were found to be missing chunks of data. These 9 columns were dropped using Python and importing Pandas as pd. I then fed the NCEI dataset into Python using “data = pd.read_csv(r’C:\\path_to_the_dataset_on_my PC. csv)”\nI used python to print the data column heads - print(data.head()))\nI had it print null data by “print(data.isnull().sum())\nI also had python drop the null columns “data_cleaned = data.dropna())\n-   Total 9 columns were dropped.\nDecoding Encoded Data: Date Conversion\nConverted DATE Column to Datetime: The DATE column originally combined both dated and time. I split this into two separate columns by using the text to column function in excel.\nSea Level Pressure (SLP) Conversion Reformatted and Converted SLP: The SLP column contained values in string format with commas as delimiters. I decoded this using the Excel’s text to column function. The same method was used to decode the Wind, Temperature, and Dew variables.\nAdding visualization to quarto document, including label and captions.\n\n7.7.4.1 Visualization in Tableau.\nThroughout this third week, I worked extensively with Tableau, finding it to be a highly enjoyable and powerful visualization tool. While there is a lot to learn within a short time, Tableau’s detailed and visually appealing outputs make the effort worthwhile. Although Tableau incorporates some object-oriented programming concepts, it’s not something we needed to delve into deeply during this period.\nThis week, I created two notable visualizations using the NCEI dataset: a static wind rose and a radial wind rose. Tableau initially struggled with generating a traditional wind rose, so I opted to create a radial one instead (Both created programtically). The wind rose, intended to mimic the function of a windmill for weather observation, serves as a graphical tool to display the distribution of wind speed and direction over a specific period. It provides a concise visual summary of how wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a location, aiding in identifying prevailing wind patterns. The wind mill describes my dataset perfectly. Below is a copy of my dashboard using Tableau.\n\nAbove Tableau Dashboard displays various visualizations of the weather center data, offering insights into wind patterns and conditions:\n\nWNDIRSPEED: This plot aims to illustrate the wind speed over time, broken down by months. It shows how wind speed fluctuates throughout different months, with January showing a noticeable peak. This could indicate periods of higher wind activity during certain months.\nRadialWR (Radial Wind Rose): The radial wind rose displays the distribution of wind direction and speed in a circular format, indicating the frequency and strength of winds coming from various directions. It helps in identifying the prevailing wind directions and their intensities.\nWndRose (Wind Rose): This is a bar chart version of a wind rose, categorizing wind speed by direction groups (N, NE, E, etc.). It shows which directions have higher wind speeds on average, indicating that winds from the NE and S directions are particularly strong in this dataset. Additionally, i have included temperature data, i supect a potential correlation between wind direction and temperature changes.\nBarChart: This chart displays the average wind speed across different bins. It shows how often different wind speed ranges occur, highlighting that higher speeds (around 80) are less frequent but still present, indicating a varied wind speed distribution.\n\nOverall Interpretation: - The visualizations suggest that wind speed and direction vary across time and direction, with some directions (NE, S) showing higher wind speeds. - There might be a relationship between wind direction and temperature, as seen in the Wind Rose plot. - The radial wind rose helps identify the most common wind directions and their speeds, which could be useful for understanding local weather patterns or for purposes like wind energy assessments.\nThese plots collectively provide a comprehensive view of the wind and temperature data, aiding in the analysis of prevailing wind conditions and their potential impact on the environment.",

    "text": "7.3 Air Quality Data Analysis and Modeling Using Excel Pivot Chart\n\n7.3.1 Data Type: CVS type, 154 entries and 6 columns.\nDataset Content: After cleaning the dataset contains 112 entries and 6 columns, representing the following variables:\nOzone: Ozone concentration (in parts per billion). Solar.R: Solar radiation (in Langley units). Wind: Wind speed (in miles per hour). Temp: Temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit). Month: Month of observation. Day: Day of the month.\nAll columns are complete with no missing values. The types of data are mostly integers, with wind speed recorded as a floating-point number\n\n\n7.3.2 Cleaning Method:\nThe dataset was cleaned exclusively using MS Excel. The Find and Replace function was employed to locate all instances of “N/A” and replace them with “0”. Afterward, a few test plots were generated, which revealed some deficiencies in the data. To address this, additional cleaning was performed by removing all rows containing “0” values.\nData Analysis Explore trends over time. Visualize correlations between temp, ozone level over time. Pivot tables were created from the dataset for analysis, and pivot charts were plotted for visualization.\nOzone and Temperature Correlation\n\n\nThis line chart shows the sum of Ozone levels, sum of Temperature, and sum of Days plotted against the Month. Here’s what can be inferred from the plot:\nB. Ozone Levels (Blue Line): Ozone levels fluctuates across the months. June shows a lower ozone level compared to July, where ozone levels peak. Ozone levels gradually decrease between July and September. This trend suggests that ozone levels are higher in July but decline towards the end of summer and into early fall.\nA. Temperature (Orange Line): Temperatures follow a rising trend from May to July, peaking in July. After peaking in July, the temperature decreases slightly in August, then increases again in Month September. This suggests that July tends to be the hottest month in the dataset, followed by slight variations in temperature in the following months.\nC. Day (Green Line): Days appear to be relatively consistent across the months, with only minor variations. This line indicates the total number of days contributing to the data for each is constant. This is an accurate visualization as the raw data shows data collected from 1st of each month to the last day.\nConclusion: The plot highlights a clear relationship between temperature and ozone levels, with both peaking in July. The consistent sum of days indicates uniform data collection across months. This pattern suggests that high summer temperatures contribute to higher ozone levels, which decline as temperatures drop towards the end of summer.\nTemperature and Wind Correlation\n\nThis combination chart displays the average temperature (bar chart) and the average wind speed (line chart) across the different months.\nA. Temperature Trends (Blue Bars): June and July have the highest average temperatures, both close to or exceeding 80 degrees. The months of May and September show relatively lower average temperatures compared to the peak summer months. Temperature is highest in July, indicating the middle of summer, and decreases slightly toward September.\nB. Wind Speed Trends (Orange Line): May starts with higher wind speeds, averaging around 10-12 mph.\nWind speeds are highest in June, with a slight drop in July, followed by relatively steady or slightly increasing wind speeds in August and September. July, which has the highest average temperature, coincides with lower wind speeds, indicating calm summer conditions.\nConclusion: The plot shows that July experiences the highest average temperatures but lower wind speeds, while June sees the highest wind speeds. This inverse trend between wind speed and temperature, especially during peak summer months, suggests that hotter conditions may coincide with calmer winds. This pattern could be typical of a warm season where high temperatures are associated with reduced wind activity.\nCombination bar chart of multiple variables across different months.\n\nKey Points Temperature and Solar Radiation: The high solar radiation levels in July and August correspond to higher average temperatures, which is typical for summer months.\nOzone and Temperature: Ozone levels are highest in July, suggesting that warmer temperatures lead to higher ozone concentrations, likely due to increased sunlight and heat contributing to ozone formation.\nWind Speed: Wind speeds are highest in the earlier months (May and June) but decrease in the peak summer months, which could imply calmer weather conditions during the hottest periods.\nConclusion: The chart visualization suggests a clear relationship between temperature, solar radiation, and ozone levels. As solar radiation and temperature increase during the summer months (especially in July), ozone levels also rise. Wind speeds, however, show an inverse relationship, with higher wind speeds occurring in the cooler months and lower wind speeds in the hotter summer months. This pattern is typical of mid-summer conditions, where higher temperatures and calmer winds create conditions conducive to higher ozone concentrations.",

    "section": "7.6 Brief Description of Plots",
    "text": "7.6 Brief Description of Plots\n\n7.6.1 Scatter Plot\nThe scatter plot displays the relationships for all four datasets from Anscombe’s Quartet. Each plot represents a pair of variables (x1 vs. y1, x2 vs. y2, etc.) with a trend line that shows the linear relationship:\nInferences from Scatter Plots:\nIf one imagines that each dataset shows a similar statistical summary (e.g., mean, standard deviation, correlation) when calculated, but the scatter plots reveal significantly different relationships and distributions:\nThe first dataset represents a simple linear relationship. The second dataset might better fit a polynomial model due to its curvature. The third dataset shows the impact of an outlier on a linear regression model. The fourth dataset emphasizes the limitation of using linear models when there is no variation in one of the variables (x), except for an outlier.\nImportance of Visualization: These plots emphasize the importance of visualizing data to understand the actual dynamics between variables, rather than solely relying on summary statistics. Despite similar summary statistics across the four datasets, the underlying data patterns and appropriate model fits are distinctly different. This visualization perfectly demonstrates the purpose of Anscombe’s Quartet: to illustrate the limitations of descriptive statistics alone and the value of graphical summaries in data analysis\n\n\n7.6.2 Histogram\nThis histogram shows the distribution of the y1 values across bins, which allows for the understand of how often each value (or range of values) occurs in the dataset.\nShape of the Distribution: The overall shape of the histogram doesn’t suggest a clear normal distribution (bell curve). Instead, it appears to have multiple clusters of values. The values seem to be slightly bimodal, with clusters around 4-5 and 8-9.\nRelation to Anscombe’s Quartet: The Anscombe’s Quartet is famous for illustrating that datasets with nearly identical statistical properties (like mean, variance, and correlation) can have very different distributions when visualized. In this case, the histogram shows that the y1 values are not uniformly or normally distributed and instead have distinct clusters.",

    "text": "8.6 Scatter Plot with Regression Line\n\n8.6.1 Observation\n\n\n8.6.2 This scatter plot with a regression line displays the relationship between temperature (Fahrenheit) and ozone levels (in parts per billion, ppb).\n\n\n8.6.3 With the data points color-coded by month. There is a clear positive correlation between temperature and ozone levels.\n\n\n8.6.4 As the temperature increases, the ozone levels tend to rise as well. This is indicated by the upward slope of the regression line.\n\n\n8.6.5 Spread of Data- While the trend is positive, there is variability in ozone levels at each temperature. This can be seen in the spread of the points, especially at higher temperatures (above 80°F), where ozone levels range significantly.\n\n\n8.6.6 Monthly Variation- The colors, corresponding to different months, show how ozone levels vary throughout the months. While the general trend remains consistent, there are slight differences in ozone concentrations at the same temperature for different months. For instance, data points from month 9 (September) are mostly seen at higher temperatures and higher ozone levels compared to earlier months.\n\n\n8.6.7 Regression Line- The black regression line provides an average trend across all months. Despite different monthly data points, the line gives a summary of how ozone levels respond to changes in temperature.\n\n\n8.6.8 Conclusion-\n\n\n8.6.9 The plot suggests that higher temperatures are associated with increased ozone levels, which could be due to chemical reactions that are emperature-dependent, such as the formation of ground-level ozone. The color variation indicates that there are monthly differences, possibly related to seasonal changes, but the general positive trend holds across the months shown.\n\n#Correlation matrix\ncorr = df[['Ozone', 'Temp', 'Wind']].corr()\nsns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\nplt.title('Correlation Matrix')\nplt.show()",

    "text": "8.8 Observations:\n\n8.8.1 Diagonal Elements- The diagonal elements (Ozone-Ozone, Temp-Temp, Wind-Wind) are all equal to 1, which is expected because any variable is perfectly correlated with itself.\n\n\n8.8.2 Ozone and Temperature (0.7)- There is a positive correlation (0.7) between Ozone and Temperature. This indicates that as the temperature increases, the ozone levels also tend to increase. A value of 0.7 shows a fairly strong positive relationship.\n\n\n8.8.3 Ozone and Wind (-0.6)- There is a negative correlation (-0.6) between Ozone and Wind. This means that higher wind speeds are generally associated with lower ozone levels. The -0.6 value suggests a moderately strong negative relationship.\n\n\n8.8.4 Temperature and Wind (-0.46)- There is a negative correlation (-0.46) between Temperature and Wind. This indicates that as temperatures increase, wind speeds tend to decrease, but the relationship is not as strong as the Ozone-Wind correlation.\n\n\n8.8.5 Summary:\n\n\n8.8.6 The matrix reveals that ozone levels are more strongly associated with temperature than wind speed. However, both wind and temperature influence ozone levels in different ways; temperature increases ozone levels, while higher wind speeds tend to decrease them.\n\n\n8.8.7 Wind speed has a moderate inverse relationship with both temperature and ozone levels, likely due to the fact that stronger winds help disperse ozone and reduce its concentration in the atmosphere.\n\n\n8.8.8 This correlation matrix is helpful for understanding how these variables interact, and can provide insights for further analysis or modeling of environmental data.",

    "text": "8.6 Scatter Plot with Regression Line\n\n8.6.1 Observation\n\n\n8.6.2 This scatter plot with a regression line displays the relationship between temperature (Fahrenheit) and ozone levels (in parts per billion, ppb).\n\n\n8.6.3 With the data points color-coded by month. There is a clear positive correlation between temperature and ozone levels.\n\n\n8.6.4 As the temperature increases, the ozone levels tend to rise as well. This is indicated by the upward slope of the regression line.\n\n\n8.6.5 Spread of Data- While the trend is positive, there is variability in ozone levels at each temperature. This can be seen in the spread of the points, especially at higher temperatures (above 80°F), where ozone levels range significantly.\n\n\n8.6.6 Monthly Variation- The colors, corresponding to different months, show how ozone levels vary throughout the months. While the general trend remains consistent, there are slight differences in ozone concentrations at the same temperature for different months. For instance, data points from month 9 (September) are mostly seen at higher temperatures and higher ozone levels compared to earlier months.\n\n\n8.6.7 Regression Line- The black regression line provides an average trend across all months. Despite different monthly data points, the line gives a summary of how ozone levels respond to changes in temperature.\n\n\n8.6.8 Conclusion-\n\n\n8.6.9 The plot suggests that higher temperatures are associated with increased ozone levels, which could be due to chemical reactions that are emperature-dependent, such as the formation of ground-level ozone. The color variation indicates that there are monthly differences, possibly related to seasonal changes, but the general positive trend holds across the months shown.\n\n#Correlation matrix\ncorr = df[['Ozone', 'Temp', 'Wind']].corr()\nsns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\nplt.title('Correlation Matrix')\nplt.show()",

    "text": "8.8 Observations:\n\n8.8.1 Diagonal Elements- The diagonal elements (Ozone-Ozone, Temp-Temp, Wind-Wind) are all equal to 1, which is expected because any variable is perfectly correlated with itself.\n\n\n8.8.2 Ozone and Temperature (0.7)- There is a positive correlation (0.7) between Ozone and Temperature. This indicates that as the temperature increases, the ozone levels also tend to increase. A value of 0.7 shows a fairly strong positive relationship.\n\n\n8.8.3 Ozone and Wind (-0.6)- There is a negative correlation (-0.6) between Ozone and Wind. This means that higher wind speeds are generally associated with lower ozone levels. The -0.6 value suggests a moderately strong negative relationship.\n\n\n8.8.4 Temperature and Wind (-0.46)- There is a negative correlation (-0.46) between Temperature and Wind. This indicates that as temperatures increase, wind speeds tend to decrease, but the relationship is not as strong as the Ozone-Wind correlation.\n\n\n8.8.5 Summary:\n\n\n8.8.6 The matrix reveals that ozone levels are more strongly associated with temperature than wind speed. However, both wind and temperature influence ozone levels in different ways; temperature increases ozone levels, while higher wind speeds tend to decrease them.\n\n\n8.8.7 Wind speed has a moderate inverse relationship with both temperature and ozone levels, likely due to the fact that stronger winds help disperse ozone and reduce its concentration in the atmosphere.\n\n\n8.8.8 This correlation matrix is helpful for understanding how these variables interact, and can provide insights for further analysis or modeling of environmental data.",

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) collected these samples in 2018, 2019, and 2021 to study how the oil is breaking down over time.\nThey tested for different chemicals that could indicate natural cleanup processes. Some of these chemicals, if present in high amounts, could be harmful to human health or the environment. The data includes things like organic carbon, ammonium, and other substances to see if the oil spill still poses any risk today.\nAs well, I created my Dashboard for this project:\n\nhttps://public.tableau.com/views/DanielasBiGDataDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link",
