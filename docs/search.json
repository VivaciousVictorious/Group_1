    "text": "Welcome to Victorious’ Page. Here, you will find all of Victorious’ submissions throughout the semester. This page is intended to track Victorious’ progress in the class and over the course of the semester.\nWeek One\n\n\nWedneday\n\n\nWEEK 1\n\nAug 28th 2024\nAir Quality Data Modeled using Excel\nInstructions:\n\nGo to our class in D2L table of contents, choose a dataset and explore\nRepeat the steps of the previous example, but do the most amount of different plots you can.\n\n\nI used a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between wind and temperature.\n\nThe plot shows a negative correlation between wind speed and temperature, meaning with increased wind speed, the temperature begins to drop. It also reveals most data points are clustered around the temperature range of 60/90 degrees and wind speed of 5/15 units, this indicates common wind and temperature within the sampled area.\nThe downward trend suggests that higher wind speeds tend to be associated with lower temperatures, but the variability in the data indicates that this is not the only factor affecting temperature.\nScatter plot seem best for visualizing relationships, below plot reveals the Ozone levels across different temperature ranges.\n\n\nThe plot reveals a generally positive relationship between temperature and ozone levels, with higher temperatures leading to higher ozone levels. The presence of an outlier suggests that under certain conditions, ozone levels can spike significantly, which may require further investigation to understand the underlying causes. The outlier might be a result of wrong calculation, error in transferring of data or a weather anomaly. At any rate, further investigation will be required to reach a conclusive decision.\n\nOzone distribution was also recorded to visualize Ozone concentration in the dataset.\n\n\nThe histogram shows that low ozone concentrations are the most common in the dataset, while higher concentrations are much less frequent. This right-skewed distribution suggests that most observations are clustered at lower ozone levels, with only a few instances of higher concentrations that could be outliers or represent unusual conditions.\n\nCloser analysis of concentration intervals:\n[0, 22]: This first interval has the highest frequency, with around 80 observations. This suggests that most ozone levels in the dataset are quite low.\n[22, 44] and [44, 66]: The frequency decreases significantly in these intervals, showing that moderate ozone levels are less common but still present.\n[66, 88] and above: The number of occurrences in these intervals continues to drop, indicating that high ozone levels are uncommon.\nThe highest intervals, [132, 154] and [154, 176], have almost no observations, confirming that extreme ozone levels are rare.\n\n\nI assumed there must exit a relationship between solar radiation and season, so i tried to module this relationship with a bar chart:\n\n\nIt made no sense. So i tried with a pivot bar chart:\n\nThe chart indicates that solar radiation peaks during the summer months, particularly in July, which aligns with typical seasonal patterns. These are the summer months where countries experience longer day light, stronger sunlight which typically leads to higher solar radiation emissions.\nThe presence of the “(blank)” bar suggests that are some missing data which resulted from cleaning the dataset and replacing ‘0’ value where ‘NA’ were otherwise recorded, specially in the solar.r data.\nOverall, the chart helps visualize how solar radiation varies throughout the year, highlighting the expected seasonal changes in sunlight exposure.\n\nWhat plot do you think represents the better data? The Pivot Chart followed by the Scatter Plot. For the purpose of the weeks lessons i will choose the Scatter Plot that models the relationship between temperature and windspeed.\nWhy? It gives for easy calculation, it depicts the best fit line for regression calculation, the different occurrences in the dataset; displaying what data cluster looks like, negative correlation and outliers. This chart could be easily chosen to teach basic statistics. However, with the Pivot Chart, it is easy to read and understand straightaway and interpret what the chart is inferring but will not be chosen to teach intro to statistics or Excel in R.\n\n\n\n\nFriday\n\n\nAtitudes\n\nInstructions:\n\nGo to our class in D2L table of contents, choose a dataset and explore\nRepeat the steps of the previous example, but do the most amount of different plots you can.\nDataset Name: Attitude\nSize = 706bytes\n\nWhat is in the Attitude dataset:\n\nThe dataset seems designed to evaluate different aspects of the work environment and how they relate to employee satisfaction, performance, and opportunities for growth.\nFor the purpose of the class, this dataset shall be applied to students instead of employees. It will be used to understand how student experience learning, how they rank their school/university, lecturers performance and opportunity for growth or continuing in higher ed within the same school.\nAnalyzing this data can help in understanding the factors that influence students attitudes towards a school and identifying areas for improvement within that school.\nDataset Variables:\n\nRating: This is the overall score or satisfaction rating given by students, perhaps based on their experience at the school.\nComplaints: Represents the number of complaints or grievances filed by students, possibly indicating dissatisfaction or issues in the school environment.\nPrivileges: Refer to the benefits or perks that certain students receive, such as the gtsnts, scholarship, PhD student privileges, or other library/sports privileges.\nLearning: Opportunities for learning and practicum, like training programs or skill enhancement opportunities available to students within certain discipline.\nRaises: Indicates how frequently or generously students receive privileges. This could be tied to grades. Students are giving raises according to their academic performances.\nCritical: This measure how critical or demanding the work load on the students are, possibly reflecting the level of pressure or stress students undergo to get these privileges.\nAdvance: Indicates opportunities for advancement within the university, showing how easy or difficult it is for students to become professors.\n\nData Modelling and Visualization\nRelationship between Rating and Raises\n\n\nThe scatter plot indicates that there is an upward trend, that is, higher ratings are often associated with higher raises. Meaning that students who receive grants and scholarships tend to rate their university experience positively and vice versa.\nMost of the data points are clustered in certain areas of the plot, particularly where the ratings and raises are both mid to high. This could mean that majority of students who receive reasonable raises are also moderately to highly satisfied.\nInterpretation\n\nThe positive correlations suggests that raises might be tied to performance or satisfaction. Students with higher marks may receive better raises as a form of reward.\nConversely, receiving scholarship and grants could incentivize a students to earn higher grade.\n\n\n\nDistribution of Learning Scores\n\n\n\nThe histogram reveals that learning scores are distributed across the dataset with most scores centered around the median indicating that most students have similar learning experiences.\nMajority of learning scores fall within the middle range, around the median of 55.5, which suggests that most students rate their learning opportunities similarly, neither extremely high nor low.\nInterpretation\n\nThe histogram shows that the university might have a consistent approach to offering learning opportunities, as most are centered around the middle.\nOn a good note, since the data is not heavily skewed, it means there might be room for improvement.\n\nCorrelation Between Complaints and Privileges\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot points are somewhat dispersed around the trend line, meaning that while there’s a general trend showing a positive correlation between complaints and privileges, the correlation isn’t very strong. Some points might be far above or below the trend line, indicating instances where the number of complaints and the level of privileges do not follow the general pattern. This variability suggests that other factors might be influencing the relationship, or that the correlation between complaints and privileges is moderate rather than strong.\nConclusion:\n\nThe dataset reflects complex relationships where certain metrics correlate positively with outcomes like privileges and raises. However, these relationships are not straightforward, indicating the presence of other influencing factors.\nThe distribution of scores and the variability observed suggest diverse performance levels and outcomes within the data, hinting at the need for further detailed analysis to uncover underlying drivers.\n\n\nWhat plot do you think represents the better data? The distribution of learning across the dataset.\nWhy? The histogram depicts the distribution learning scores accurately, it holds several information; for instance, certain score ranges are more common which indicates varying levels of difficulty or achievement among the participants. This could so by the school of departments design. It could be that convergence of performance around mean is due to standardized assessments or common learning patterns which most students have come to expect or most students understood the topics more than other topics.\nReported the findings in - excel-basics_Attitude_Fashina_082624.\n\n\n\n\nSaturday\n\n\n\nWeek 1 Project\n\n\n\nVisualization Of National Centers For Environmental Information (NCEI) Dataset\n\nInstruction for completing assignment:\nFrom your project source provide simple visualization of a dataset you can find in your source.\n\nAdd the method used and the following information to your quarto report:\n\nThe context of the dataset\nThe dataset is a collection of meteorological observations from a specific weather station identified as “KJELLER AIRPORT, NO”. This dataset is used by the National Center For Environmental Information (NCEI) for studying weather trends, creating predictive models, or understanding how atmospheric conditions change over time.\nBased on the column names and data structure, the dataset consists of:\n\nGeographical Information: - STATION, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, ELEVATION: These columns provide details about the specific location where the weather observations were recorded.\nTime-based Observations: - Date/Time: The dataset records weather data at hourly intervals, providing a time-series structure for analyzing weather patterns.\nMeteorological Data: - SLP (Sea Level Pressure): Atmospheric pressure at sea level, which is useful in studying weather systems, such as predicting storm conditions or high-pressure systems. - WND, TMP, VIS, DEW, etc.: These columns seem to encode data on wind speed/direction, temperature, visibility, dew point, and other weather-related variables. They are stored in a format that requires further decoding.\n\n\n\nPurpose: - It would appear that the is used for tracking and analyzing weather conditions over time at the specified station. It could be useful for forecasting, climate studies, or aviation-related weather monitoring.\n\nThe source and link to the dataset (csv)\n\nThe source is National Centre For Environment Information (NCEI)\n\nhttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/access/2024/01466099999.csv\n\nName : 2024-08-26 10:32 - 93K\nOriginal dataset consists of 301 rows and 25 columns.\nCleaned dataset consists of 301 rows and 28 columns.\n\n9 columns were deleted(correlation with other columns not clear and also not necessary for this analysis)\n5 of the original columns were decoded into 11 additional columns:\n\nWind is decoded into\n\nWind_Direction\nWind_Speed_Tenths\nWind_Speed_Quality\nWind_Speed_Meters\nWind_Type\n\nTemperature is decoded into\n\nTemperature_Celsius\nTemperature_Quality\n\nSea_Level_Pressure_hPa is decoded into\n\nSea_Level_Pressure_hPa\nSLP_Quality\n\nDew is decoded into 2 columns\n\nDew_Point_Celsius\nDew_Point_Quality\n\nDate was seperated to 2 columns\n\nDate\nTime\n\n\n\n\n\nData Cleaning Methods Employed\n\nColumn Selection\nOut of the original 25 columns, 9 were found to be missing chunks of data. These 9 columns were dropped using Python and importing Pandas as pd. I then fed the NCEI dataset into Python using “data = pd.read_csv(r’C:\\path_to_the_dataset_on_my PC. csv)”\nI had python print the data column heads - print(data.head()))\nI had it print null data by “print(data.isnull().sum())\ni had python drop the null columns “data_cleaned = data.dropna())\nTotal 9 columns were dropped.\nDecoding Encoded Data:\nDate Conversion\n\nConverted DATE Column to Datetime: The DATE column originally combined both dated and time. I split this into two separate columns by using the text to column function in excel.\nSea Level Pressure (SLP) Conversion\n\nReformatted and Converted SLP: The SLP column contained values in string format with commas as delimiters. I decoded this using the Excel’s text to column function. The same method was used to decode the Wind, Temperature, and Dew variables.\n\n\nAdd your visualization to your quarto document, add label and caption.\nAdd a description of what we should understand from your visualization, and how this connect with your project scope.\n\n\nAbove Line plot models the relationship between the sea level pressure and time. Here’s my analysis:\n\nInitial Decline: The plot begins with a relatively steady but slow decrease in SLP during the first few months of 2024 (January through May).\nSharp Increase: Around June, there is a significant, sharp increase in SLP, jumping to a much higher value.\nPlateau: After this large spike, the SLP seems to stabilize at a new elevated level, remaining constant through July and August.\n\n\n\nPossible Interpretation:\n\n\nThe initial period shows some minor fluctuations or a gradual decline in sea level pressure, which might indicate typical atmospheric conditions.\nThe sharp rise could suggest a sudden weather event or anomaly that caused a dramatic increase in pressure.\nThe stabilization afterward could be due to stable high-pressure systems or data issues (such as errors in recording or data entry).\n\nTemperature Over Time\n\n\nObserving the interaction between temperature and time reveals a general increase in temperature over time, however, above plot shows some extremely high temperature values . This suggests that there may be underlying issues with the data which might require further investigation of the dataset.\nTIME TO RECHECK DATA FOR ANOMALY!\n\nFrom row number 126, the dataset was discovered to be corrupt. I proceeded to remove these rows and ran the test again. Sea_Level and Months.\n\n\n\nPIVOT TABLE CHALLENGE\nPivot Tables by default sum up the number formatted columns on the table. This plot, by doing, gave unrealistic figures of temperature values, rising to 35 thousand hpa. I revisted the Pivot table and changed the summation method to ‘average’ and the below plot is the result.\n\nThe new plot, with the average aggregation applied, provides a more accurate depiction of sea-level pressure trends over time. The values are within the expected range, and the daily fluctuations suggest typical atmospheric behavior. See below to information about atmospheric behaviour.\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/atmosphere/air-pressure#:~:text=Therefore%2C%201%20hectopascal%20(hPa),)%20and%20hectopascal%20(hPa).\n\nThe corrected Sea_level_Pressure Vs Date now looks like this:\n\n\nThe plot provides a better representation of how sea-level pressure changes over time. It also shows outliers in the dataset which warrant further investigation. Despite the outliers, the rest of the data appears to follow a consistent pattern showing typical fluctuations that could be linked to daily and seasonal atmospheric changes.\nTemperature over time now looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe plot suggests a steady decrease in temperature over the 10-day period from December 31, 2023, to January 10, 2024. The temperatures drop from around -5°C to -30°C, likely due to seasonal winter progression. This trend matches in extreme cold weather proves the area the dataset reports as its origin, could be of interest in understanding the local climate patterns or preparing for extreme cold conditions; kjeller Airfield, Norway. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kjeller_Airfield.\n\n\nThe plot also proves true about Norway’s weather in December/January. https://www.campervannorway.com/blog/travel-ideas/norway-in-january#:~:text=As%20a%20midwinter%20month%2C%20January,dry%20to%20rainy%20or%20snowy.",
