## Friday Week 3

In Friday's class, I worked on applying what I learned from Wednesday's practice with the TreeData set in Tableau. I used the same ideas and methods but with my midterm data this time. I focused on creating charts and graphs to better understand my data. It was a good way to get more comfortable with Tableau and practice using it for real data, which made everything click a bit more.
